Almonds	are	fairly	versatile	in	that	their	flavor	is	not	very	specific.	When	they	are	manufactured,	then
they	have	a	distinct	flavor:	think	of	Frangelico,	almond	oil,	or	marzipan	in	dessert.	In	these	cases,	the
almond	has	a	very	distinct	flavor.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

If	you	have	some	beautiful	almonds,	there	are	so	many	things	you	can	do.	You	can	grind	them	and	make	a
frangipane	and	put	it	in	puff	pastry.	You	can	put	them	into	biscotti,	a	cake,	or	almond	ice	cream.

No	country	in	the	world	has	anchovies	like	Spain.	They	are	sophisticated,	and	the	ones	from	the	north	of
Spain	are	best	because	they	are	bigger.	Spanish	anchovies	are	not	salty,	either.	Once	you	eat	one,	your	life
changes	forever!	I	pay	a	lot	for	my	anchovies	—	up	to	seventy-five	cents	per	fillet	—	and	will	have	to
charge	$9	for	a	plate.	My	customers	will	say	that	is	too	much	to	pay,	and	I	agree	—	but	if	you	don’t	pay,
you	don’t	taste.	Lately,	I	have	been	combining	anchovies	with	nectarines,	which	I	love.	I	will	make	a
vinaigrette	with	Pedro	Ximénez	[i.e.,	PX	sherry],	sherry	vinegar,	and	olive	oil	and	it	is	the	perfect

The	combination	of	apple	and	celery	works.	A	tart	green	apple	sorbet	is	not	going	to	knock	your	socks
off,	because	you	are	programmed	to	know	it.	When	you	add	the	flavor	of	celery,	you	get	something	new.	I
also	love	the	flavors	of	apple	and	fennel	together,	especially	in	sorbet.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	make	an	apple	confit	of	thinly	sliced	apples	with	cinnamon	caramel	powder	layered	between	the	apples
and	baked	slowly.	When	the	dish	is	served,	next	to	the	apples	is	a	small	pile	of	dates	poached	in	syrup
with	vanilla.	The	other	flavors	on	the	plate	are	lemon	confit,	quince,	raw	apple	with	apple	cider	gelée,
and	ras	el	hanout	(a	Moroccan	spice	blend).

For	this	dish	you	need	a	contrast	for	the	sweetness,	so	the	role	of	the	lemon	confit	is	to	cleanse	and

refresh.	If	the	confit	was	not	there,	you	would	have	a	bite	of	the	sweet	date	and	be	done.	The	date	and
lemon	is	like	a	salad.	The	line	drawing	this	together	is	the	quince	and	dates	that	come	from	the	Middle
East	and	that	was	the	line	to	ras	el	hanout.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

If	you	cook	apples	on	top	of	the	stove,	some	varieties	will	have	a	lot	of	juice	while	others	will	have	none
at	all.	Fuji,	Gala,	and	Golden	Delicious	apples	tend	to	be	juicy,	while	Granny	Smith	apples	are	often
drier.	With	different	types	of	apples,	you	often	don’t	know	exactly	what	they	will	do.	So	if	I’m	going	to
serve	apples	with	gingerbread,	I	will	sauté	them	in	a	little	sugar	and	see	what	happens.	If	they	are	letting
out	a	bunch	of	juice,	I	won’t	add	much	sugar.	If	they	are	dry,	I’ll	add	some	apple	juice	or	Calvados.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

When	I	make	an	apple	pie,	I	won’t	use	any	fewer	than	three	different	kinds	of	apples	for	their	different
textures	and	sweetnesses,	which	ensures	that	every	single	bite	is	interesting.	I’ll	use	Galas	or	Golden
Delicious	apples	for	their	sweetness	in	the	middle	of	the	pie,	and	soft	Jonathans	or	McIntoshes	on	top	for
their	ability	to	melt	into	the	others,	and	Braeburns	or	Granny	Smiths	on	the	bottom	for	their	ability	to	stay
firm.	.	.	.	I	can’t	imagine	an	apple	pie	without	cinnamon,	a	splash	of	lemon	juice,	and	a	pinch	of	salt.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

Apples	and	caramel	are	a	wonderful	combination	and	depending	on	what	nut	you	add	it	will	take	the
combination	in	very	different	directions.	If	you	add	pecans,	it	would	make	the	combination	a	heavier
winter	dessert,	versus	adding	almonds,	which	would	keep	it	lighter.	Both	work;	you	just	need	to	decide
how	heavy	you	want	the	dish.

Apple	and	shiso	work	well	together.	I	especially	like	them	together	in	a	sorbet.	I	will	use	a	Granny	Smith
apple	that	has	a	nice	tartness	combined	with	a	little	sugar,	lemon,	and	then	the	shiso.	The	shiso	has	a
cumin	and	cinnamon	flavor	that	is	a	natural	with	apple.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

If	you	stay	in	the	boundaries	of	what	people	think	a	dessert	should	be	it	gets	very	hard	to	do	something
new.	We	explain	that	they	already	eat	carrot	cake.	We	think	parsnip	will	work	instead	of	carrot	and	that
kabocha	squash	will	work	instead	of	pumpkin	in	a	pie.

When	people	see	eggplant	in	a	dessert	they	automatically	think	it	will	not	work.	You	have	to	hide	the

unusual	element	and	play	up	what	people	know	already.	The	boundaries	are	limitless	when	you	think	of
all	the	crossovers	between	sweet	and	savory.	Duck	à	l’orange	is	a	fruit	and	meat	combined,	so	why	not
use	bacon	in	a	dessert?	A	pancake	with	maple	syrup	and	bacon	on	the	plate	is	really	sweet	and	savory.	So
people	already	eat	these	combinations	unconsciously.

For	our	apple-eggplant	dessert,	we	start	with	a	choux	dough	piecrust.	Then	we	layer	an	almond
cream-like	custard.	Then	we	alternate	apple	and	eggplant	slices	side	by	side.	We	use	baby	eggplant
because	it	has	a	spongy	texture	and	sucks	up	moisture	from	the	cream	that	can	otherwise	make	the	crust
soggy	and	absorb	the	juice	and	flavor	from	the	apples	that	would	normally	just	evaporate.	So	when	you
eat	the	eggplant	and	apples,	the	eggplant	tastes	like	apples.
—	DOMINIQUE	AND	CINDY	DUBY,	WILD	SWEETS	(VANCOUVER)

I	have	always	been	very	fond	of	chef	Frédy	Girardet	[who	earned	three	Michelin	stars	at	his	restaurant	in
Switzerland	before	retiring	in	1996].	When	I	was	young,	I	cooked	almost	every	recipe	from	his	book	and
visited	his	restaurant.	One	of	his	most	interesting	desserts	was	an	apple	dessert	made	of	apples	in	the
shape	of	little	balls.	The	dessert	broke	away	from	cooking	apples	whole	in	the	traditional	way,	which
alone	inspired	me.	He	cooked	them	over	a	very	high	heat	for	two	minutes	and	put	them	into	a	red	wine
reduction	that	had	cinnamon,	orange	peel,	and	sugar.	This	was	put	onto	a	sheet	tray	that	needed	to	be
shaken	for	an	hour	so	the	apples	would	not	dry	out.	The	apples	would	absorb	these	flavors	like	a	sponge
and	would	then	be	served	with	vanilla	ice	cream.

In	that	spirit,	we	transformed	this	dessert.	We	transformed	the	wine	by	“espherication”	so	that	it
creates	a	bubble	of	liquid	that	explodes	in	your	mouth.	We	cut	apples	with	a	melon	baller,	then	vacuum-
packed	the	apples	with	the	wine	but	cooked	it	in	such	a	way	that	the	apples	stayed	hard	and	absorbed	the
wine	flavor.

We	serve	a	dish	of	smoked	oysters	with	apples.	We	smoke	the	oysters	over	applewood,	and	so	it	seemed
logical	to	add	apple	to	the	dish.	We	serve	it	with	a	puree	of	apple	with	juniper	that	just	plays	beautifully
off	the	oyster.

Apricots	are	much	better	cooked	than	raw.	It	is	rare	that	you	find	a	fruit	that	reaches	its	full	potential	as
cooked	rather	than	raw,	but	an	apricot	is	one.	A	so-so	apricot	poached	will	turn	into	heaven.	They	are

Apricot	is	a	fruit	you	need	to	cook	to	help	unleash	its	flavors.	A	bite	of	raw	apricot	is	kind	of	bland	and
doesn’t	excite	very	much.	If	you	throw	that	same	apricot	into	the	oven	and	heat	it	up	a	bit,	it	turns	into	a

we	serve	here.	Panko	bread	crumbs	are	mixed	with	chopped	mint,	salted,	and	stuffed	into	the	artichoke
cavity.	The	homemade	mayonnaise	I	serve	is	made	with	eggs	and	just	a	little	olive	oil	but	mostly	melted
butter,	which	makes	it	richer	and	more	flavorful	—	which	is	based	on	how	it	is	made	for	the	Chinese	dish

Daniel	Humm	of	New	York’s	Eleven	Madison	Park	on
Making	Asparagus	Soup
Making	and	seasoning	soup	is	one	of	the	best	ways	to	learn	about	flavor.	Let’s	make
asparagus	soup:


•	You	need	a	lot	of	asparagus	flavor.
•	You	need	acidity.
•	You	need	sweetness	that	will	come	from	the	asparagus.
•	You	need	the	right	amount	of	salt.
•	You	need	just	the	right	amount	of	spice,	so	that	it	doesn’t	actually	taste	spicy.	We	use	a	lot	of

cayenne,	but	you	would	never	know	it	is	there;	it	is	just	an	accent.

•	You	need	fresh	lime	juice	to	finish.

Soup	is	a	play	of	balance	when	you	have	a	lot	of	flavor.	You	can	add	a	lot	of	salt	and	it	won’t	taste	salty.
You	can	add	a	lot	of	acid	and	it	won’t	taste	acidic.	But	you	still	have	a	bold-flavored	soup.	It’s	like
winemaking;	at	some	point,	there	is	a	balance	of	all	the	flavors.

The	first	thing	you	need	to	do	is	get	all	the	asparagus	flavor	into	the	soup	at	the	start.	We	save	our

asparagus	liquid	from	all	the	asparagus	we	cook	to	use	for	asparagus	stock.

Making	the	soup:	We	sweat	the	asparagus	[that	is,	cook	it	over	low	heat	in	a	little	fat,	generally	in	a
covered	pot	or	pan]	very	slowly.	When	we	add	wine,	we	do	it	multiple	times,	adding	a	little	at	a	time	and
reducing	it,	then	repeating	the	process.	What	this	does	is	concentrate	the	flavor	at	each	step.	It	makes	a	big
difference	[before	adding	the	asparagus	liquid].

Finishing	the	soup:	A	soup	may	taste	seasoned,	but	it	still	needs	to	be	“woken	up.”	You	taste	the
asparagus,	but	maybe	it	doesn’t	blow	you	away	at	first.	To	do	that,	you	need	acid	and	cayenne.	We	season
the	soup	with	lime	because	it	is	a	stronger	acid	and	yet	has	less	flavor	than	lemon.	If	I	use	lemon	to	geas
much	acid	as	I	need	for	the	soup,	I	will	need	to	use	so	much	that	the	soup	will	taste	lemony	instead.

—	HIRO	SONE	AND	LISSA	DOUMANI,	TERRA	(ST.	HELENA,	CALIFORNIA)


In	the	autumn,	I	use	walnut	vinegar,	which	is	red	wine	vinegar	with	macerated	walnuts	in	it.	It	is	great	on
a	dish	of	sweetbreads	and	hazelnuts.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	I	think	of	autumn,	I	think	of	apples,	pears,	quince	—	which	is	so	underrated	—	figs,	and	pumpkins.
I	work	with	apples	and	pears,	which	you	can	start	using	in	September,	especially	with	the	early
apples	like	Gravenstein	in	the	Bay	Area.	I	try	not	to	use	pumpkin	until	close	to	Halloween,	because	no
matter	what	you	do	with	it,	it	will	still	taste	like	pumpkin.	It’s	not	like	berries	or	apples	that	you	can	do	a
thousand	things	with.	As	a	pastry	chef,	if	I	serve	pumpkin	too	soon,	people	will	get	sick	of	it	—	and	if	I
take	it	off	the	menu,	there	is	nothing	to	replace	it	with.	So	I	try	to	wait	so	I	don’t	peak	too	early.

Figs	are	great	for	fall.	The	problem	with	figs	is	that	there	are	not	that	many	fig	lovers	out	there.	There
are	a	lot	more	peach,	chocolate,	and	apple	lovers	than	there	are	fig	lovers.	When	I	make	a	fig	dessert,	I’ll
pair	it	with	a	raspberry	or	late	summer	fruit	so	it’s	more	likely	to	meet	with	customer	acceptance.

In	the	fall,	I’ll	make	more	cakes.	Fall	also	turns	into	caramel	season,	and	fall	fruits	work	so	well	with

caramel.	I	keep	a	lighter	hand	with	caramel	in	the	fall	because	it	is	being	combined	with	fruit	versus
chocolate.

Bacon	can	be	salt,	fat,	and/or	smoke,	depending	on	the	bacon	you	choose.	You	can	also	play	with	its
texture,	depending	on	whether	you	are	using	pork	belly	or	crispy	bacon.	It	is	wonderful	with	vegetables.
The	fat	is	delicious,	so	if	you	are	braising	onions	in	bacon	fat,	reduce	that	down,	and	add	a	little	onion	jus
and	vinegar,	you	have	a	great	sauce.	Bacon	just	brings	another	layer	of	flavor	to	the	vegetables.	My	dish
of	Berkshire	pork	chop	with	scarlet	turnips,	roasted	rhubarb,	and	smoked	bacon	with	cherry-almond	salsa
seca	represents	the	relationship	between	fat,	salt,	sugar,	and	acid;	they	are	all	there.	The	bacon	brings
complexity	to	the	pork;	the	cherry	brings	acid	balance;	and	the	almond	brings	a	different	kind	of	fat	with
crunch.	The	almonds	in	the	dish	are	marcona,	and	every	tenth	one	is	extremely	bitter,	which	adds	another
layer	of	complexity.

BALANCE

Tips:	Seek	balance	in	every	dish	you	make:

•		tastes	(e.g.,	sourness	vs.	saltiness;	sweetness	vs.	bitterness)
•		richness	(e.g.,	fat)	vs.	relief	(e.g.,	acidity,	bitterness)


•		temperatures	(e.g.,	hot	vs.	cold)
•		textures	(e.g.,	creamy	vs.	crunchy)
Balance	taste	by	adding	its	opposite	or	its	complement.

—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	hate	overripe	bananas.	We’ll	actually	freeze	whole,	unpeeled	bananas,	which	will	continue	to	ripen	in
the	freezer	and	turn	black.	When	we	want	bananas	to	use	as	a	puree,	we’ll	pull	them	out	and	let	them	thaw
before	pureeing,	and	then	add	them	to	a	cake	or	mousse.	The	flavor	is	much	better	this	way.
—	DOMINIQUE	DUBY,	WILD	SWEETS	(VANCOUVER)

I	serve	a	banana	crème	brûlée	that	is	not	made	in	ramekins	(the	usual	individual	serving	cups)	but	cut	out
of	a	sheet	pan	and	caramelized.	I	serve	this	set	up	in	a	grid	with	two	squares	of	crème	brûlée,	one	topped
with	a	little	citrus,	the	other	with	caramelized	bananas	—	alternated	with	citrus	biscuit,	one	topped	with	a
brown	butter	ice	cream,	and	the	other	with	caramelized	banana.	So	I	have	these	three	flavors	—	banana,
citrus,	and	brown	butter	—	tied	together	with	a	salted	peanut–caramel	sauce.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

A	banana’s	ripeness	will	determine	what	you	do	with	it.	I	like	my	bananas	yellow	and	firm.	If	you	are
going	to	make	a	bananas	Foster	and	your	bananas	are	very	yellow,	you	can	cook	them	longer	and	they
won’t	fall	apart	or	turn	to	mush.	If	you	start	with	a	banana	that	is	pretty	brown,	the	second	you	add	heat,	it
falls	apart.	A	brown	banana	gives	me	shivers!

I	use	basil	a	lot.	I	will	add	it	at	the	very	end	of	cooking	a	dish,	and	it	will	totally	change	where	thdish	is
going.	Added	at	the	last	second,	it	gives	a	minty	freshness	that	was	not	there	before.	Basil	says	“fresh”
and	“alive”	to	me.	And	although	you	can	get	it	year-round,	I	associate	it	with	summer.

I	think	particularly	of	fish	and	shellfish	with	basil.	I	cook	a	lobster	with	a	sauce	of	sweet	Muscat	or

Sauternes,	curry,	and	lime.	This	is	a	dish	that	has	been	played	with.	The	shells	have	been	chopped	up,
added	to	mirepoix,	and	turned	into	sauce.	Then	there’s	wine.	So	when	the	basil	hits,	you	have	this	whole
new	thing	going	on.	It	opens	up	the	dish	and	makes	it	light.	It	goes	against	the	“worked-on”	aspect	of	the
dish.

In	Thai	cooking,	you	will	find	coconut	milk–based	curry	that	will	have	whole	leaves	of	basil	in	it.

Basil	becomes	something	of	a	vegetable	served	this	way.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	basil	in	syrups.	It	works	with	strawberries	and	any	citrus	fruit.	The	trio	I	use	the	most	for	summer
fruits	like	berries	is	basil,	lemon,	and	vanilla.	I	have	even	macerated	cherry	tomatoes	in	this	combination
and	made	them	into	a	fruit	crisp.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	basil.	It	is	more	familiar	than	cilantro,	and	more	people	like	it.	I	use	it	in	ceviche	instead	of	cilantro
because	it	is	not	as	pungent.	I	combine	hamachi	tuna	with	tomato,	watermelon,	yuzu,	and	sesame	seeds
with	fresh	basil	and	basil	oil.

I	am	a	little	too	fond	of	bay	leaf.	I	use	it	a	lot.	I	probably	have	a	fondness	for	it	because	I	associate	it	with
so	many	childhood	flavors,	like	pot	roast.	It	has	a	hearty	quality	to	it	and	I	associate	it	with	stocks	anbig
flavors.	I	will	use	fresh	or	dried	bay	leaf.	Fresh	bay	leaf	has	fresher	flavor	and	is	surprisingly	more
intense	than	dried	bay	leaf,	but	it’s	still	not	as	dramatic	a	difference	as	you	can	find	with	other	herbs	when
it	comes	to	fresh	versus	dried.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Inexperienced	cooks	will	throw	a	handful	of	bay	leaves	into	40	gallons	of	veal	stock.	What	happens	next
is	they	go	to	make	a	sauce	and	can’t	figure	out	what	to	do	about	the	medicinal	taste.	It’s	the	bay	leaf!	I’ll
explain	they	only	need	two	or	three	at	the	most.

Fava	beans	have	a	great	flavor.	Cooks	in	the	past	would	blanch	them,	and	the	flavor	would	be	left	in	the
water.	Today,	what	I	like	to	do	with	favas	and	other	vegetables	is	to	put	them	in	a	pan	with	a	little	water,
olive	oil,	or	butter,	and	to	cover	them	while	they	cook.	That	way,	all	the	flavor	stays	in	the	vegetables.	If	I
could	cook	for	my	customers	the	way	I	like	to	cook	and	eat	at	home,	I	would	sweat	some	spring	onions	in
a	pan	with	butter	or	oil,	covered,	to	keep	in	the	flavor.	Then	I’d	add	the	shucked	fava	beans	and	let	them
cook	with	a	little	water.	At	the	last	second,	I’d	toss	in	some	chopped	parsley	or	basil,	and	there’s	your
sauce.	This	would	be	great	under	some	fish.	If	you	added	some	thyme	and	maybe	a	little	lamb	jus,	it
would	also	work	with	lamb.
—	TRACI	DES	JARDINS,	JARDINIÈRE	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Fava	beans	have	a	very	delicate	flavor,	I	like	them	raw	and	tender	by	themselves	—	or	combined	with
sheep’s	milk	cheese	and	olive	oil.	However,	I	wouldn’t	use	an	olive	oil	that’s	too	peppery	or	spicy,
because	it	would	overwhelm	them.

I	love	blue	cheese	with	beef.	We	make	a	dish	with	blue	cheese	sauce	that	has	chicken	stock,	Dijon
mustard,	truffle	juice,	and	fresh	truffle.	This	is	a	sauce	that	has	many	layers	of	flavor.	The	mustard	is
barely	there	but	adds	much	more	flavor	to	the	sauce	than	vinegar	or	lemon	would.	The	sauce	is	served	on
a	[beef]	filet	that	has	been	poached	in	spiced	red	wine.	The	poaching	liquid	is	made	with	Cabernet
Sauvignon	that	has	been	reduced	for	25	minutes	to	concentrate	its	flavor,	juniper	berries,	pepper,	star
anise,	fennel	seeds,	and	cloves.	The	cooked	tannin	in	the	wine	really	brings	up	the	meaty	flavor	of	the
beef.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

All	cuts	of	beef	have	a	different	flavor	profile:	There	is	the	big	beefy	flavor	of	the	strip	steak,	the
luxurious	tenderness	of	filet	mignon,	and	the	juicy,	fatty	mouthfeel	of	a	great	rib	eye.	Skirt	steak	is	a	juicy
cut	that	is	great	served	as	an	open-faced	sandwich.	Hanger	steak	has	an	offal	quality	to	it	and	is	different
from	all	the	others.	Braised	short	ribs	pick	up	all	of	the	flavors	of	what	they	are	cooked	with,	developing
layers	of	deep,	dark	beef	flavor	after	being	cooked	on	the	bone	for	hours.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)


We	make	a	wood-grilled	18-ounce	“prime”	rib	eye	of	beef	with	a	gratin	of	macaroni	and	goat	cheese,
glazed	shallots,	oxtail	red	wine	sauce,	and	fleur	de	sel.	This	dish	is	meat	on	meat	on	meat!	We	have	the
steak,	oxtail	sauce,	and	shallots	braised	in	veal	stock.	This	dish	has	so	much	flavor.	You	have	the	richness
and	fattiness	of	the	rib	eye,	and	we	grill	it	over	a	wood	fire	that	takes	it	to	a	whole	other	place.	Toit
with	a	drizzle	of	olive	oil,	the	fleur	de	sel,	cracked	pepper,	and	then	add	rich	oxtail	sauce	to	it.	People	go

You	can	braise	brisket	for	hours,	and	it	still	tastes	like	brisket,	making	it	ideal	to	prepare	for	large

Texans	get	the	fattiest	brisket	I	have	ever	seen,	so	the	fat	just	melts	away	and	the	meat	is	self-basting.	My
favorite	barbecued	brisket	is	from	Mueller’s	outside	of	Austin.	He	cooks	it	about	twenty	hours	and	then
wraps	it	in	brown	butcher	paper	to	let	it	rest	—	which	I	think	is	the	key	to	his	barbecue.

BEEF	—	SHORT	LOIN

This	is	the	T-bone	steak.	When	it	is	cut	double	cut	[that	is,	twice	as	thick],	that	is	when	it	is	a	porterhouse.
The	story	goes	that	it	was	first	served	in	Lower	Manhattan	in	1815	at	a	porter	house.	The	owner	ran	out	of
his	usual	cut	of	meat,	and	when	a	customer	asked	for	something	to	go	with	his	porter	[beer],	the	owner	cut
him	this	huge	piece	of	meat.	It	became	known	as	a	“porterhouse”	steak.	The	porterhouse	steak	is	part	filet
mignon	and	part	strip	steak.	It	is	the	perfect	grilling	steak.	You	get	the	tenderness	of	the	filet,	and	the	big
beefy	chewiness	of	the	strip	steak.

Vikram	Vij	of	Vancouver’s	Vij’s	on	Beef	Short	Ribs	in
Cinnamon
For	braising,	I	prefer	to	use	cinnamon	bark.	Cinnamon	stick	is	pretty,	but	it	is	steamed	and
rolled	and	a	little	too	manipulated.	In	this	dish,	cinnamon	bark	is	big	and	intense	and	not
needed	for	presentation.	At	the	end	of	the	braise,	you	pull	it	out	and	throw	it	away.	This
dish	is	cooked	for	four	hours	and	the	cinnamon	flavor	does	not	cook	out.	In	the	end,	the
cinnamon	imparts	a	delicate,	sweet,	aromatic	flavor.	It	adds	contrast	to	the	chile	flavor	from
the	curry.	If	this	dish	ever	has	too	much	cinnamon	flavor,	you	can	counterbalance	it	with	rice
or	yogurt	that	has	a	little	salt	and	pepper	in	it.

Short	ribs	are	a	luxurious	cut	of	meat,	because	they	are	braised	for	three	to	three	and	a	half	hours.	We
don’t	braise	our	ribs	in	red	wine,	but	in	Yuengling	Porter,	which	has	ethereal	chocolate	notes	in	the
aroma.	In	the	sauce	with	the	beer	is	mirepoix,	a	sachet	of	herbs,	lots	of	peppercorns,	and	chiles.	I	went	to
a	charity	event	where	they	served	short	ribs	for	six	hundred	guests,	and	one	reason	it	worked	is	because	it
is	a	cut	that	allows	for	a	great	margin	of	error.	You	cook	it	until	it	is	well	done	and	falling-off-the-bone
tender.	Falling-off-the-bone	tender	is	one	of	the	appeals	of	a	braised	dish.	It	is	sensual.	Get	yourself	a
glass	of	good	spicy	Syrah	with	that	short	rib	dish	and	think	great	thoughts!

BEEF	—	STEAK:	CHUCK

for	braising.	A	chuck	also	makes	a	good	cut	for	stew	because	it	has	nice	fat.	When	I	was	growing	up,	a

Filet	mignon	gets	no	respect	from	many	chefs	because	it	doesn’t	have	much	beef	flavor,	but	it	is	still	the
most	popular	cut	in	restaurants.	I	like	to	sear	it	and	pan	roast	it	with	a	little	olive	oil	or	an	olive	oiand
butter	combination.	It	is	not	a	well-used	muscle	on	the	inside	of	the	short	loin,	so	filet	is	always	tender.
On	the	other	side	of	the	bone	from	the	more	worked	side	of	the	strip	steak	is	the	tail	end	of	the	filet.
Béarnaise	sauce	[i.e.,	vinegar,	shallots,	egg	yolks,	butter,	etc.]	is	a	classic	accompaniment	to	filet	mignon.

Skirt	steak	comes	in	a	long	strip	and	looks	like	a	belt	—	it’s	about	two	feet	long	and	a	couple	of	inches

popular	in	the	Latin	community,	especially	with	Argentinians.	You	often	see	it	flattened	with	a	mallet	to
tenderize	it	[by	breaking	the	meat	fibers]	and	used	in	fajitas.	This,	along	with	the	hanger	steak,	is	the
beefiest	flavored	cut	of	beef.	We	serve	it	in	a	chimichurri	sauce,	which	is	a	classic	Argentinian	sauce

You	want	the	texture	of	the	beef	to	be	a	counterpoint.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Michael	Lomonaco	of	Porter	House	New	York	on	Cooking
Steak
Aging:	Aging	is	important	because	it	tenderizes	the	steak.	The	aging	process	breaks	down
the	fibers	and	dehydrates	the	steak,	concentrating	its	flavor.	A	dry-aged	steak	has	a	more
minerally	and	sharp	edge	to	it,	versus	fresh	meat	that	tastes	sweeter.	It	is	critical	to	the
flavor	and	adds	to	the	cost	because	it	takes	four	weeks	of	aging	to	achieve	it.

Seasoning:	All	our	steaks	are	seasoned	with	coarse	kosher	salt	and	freshly	ground
black	pepper	just	prior	to	cooking,	which	draws	out	the	flavor	while	they	cook.	A	squeeze	of
lemon	makes	a	good	Tuscan	steak	taste	even	better.	If	you	are	in	Italy	and	eating	“bistecca
Fiorentina,”	what	you	are	having	is	an	Italian	porterhouse.	The	steak	is	grilled	over	dried
grape	vines	and	served	with	a	drizzle	of	green	olive	oil	from	the	first	pressing	of	the	new
harvest	and	lemons	on	the	side.

Cooking:	A	steak	should	be	cooked	rare	to	medium	rare.	“Rare”	is	a	little	cool	inside
and	hot	on	the	exterior.	“Medium	rare”	is	just	a	shade	past,	and	only	warm	in	the	middle.
Cooking	a	steak	beyond	that	point,	it	starts	to	toughen	up	and	the	fat	oozes	out,	making	it
increasingly	dry	and	tough.

Saucing:	Part	of	looking	forward	is	looking	back.	Sauces	provide	the	connection	to
historical	French	and	Italian	cooking.	In	the	gastronomic	world,	the	saucier	was	the	top
cook	in	the	kitchen.	It	is	all	about	building	layer	upon	layer	of	complexity	in	a	sauce.	It	is
most	often	sweet	and	sour,	to	cut	through	the	richness	of	the	fat	of	the	steak.	Red	wine
sauce	has	the	acidity	to	cut	richness,	with	sweetness	from	caramelized	shallots,	and	it
enhances	the	beef	flavor.	We	also	make	a	homemade	barbecue	sauce	as	our	steak	sauce,
which	is	sweet	from	light	brown	sugar	and	molasses,	tart	from	red	wine	vinegar,	and	smoky
from	chipotle	peppers.

Hanger	steak	is	known	as	an	onglet	in	French	and	is	found	on	bistro	menus.	It	is	also	a	great	value,


which	is	why	you	see	it	on	menus	in	smaller	restaurants.	A	hanger	steak	is	incredibly	flavorful.	There	is
only	one	per	carcass,	and	it	comes	from	the	area	close	to	the	kidneys,	so	it	has	almost	an	offal	flavor	to
the	beef.	It	has	become	popular	because	it	is	different	and	not	a	typical-tasting	steak.	I	like	a	hanger	steak
grilled	and	served	rare	to	medium	rare.	Slicing	is	also	important,	because	you	have	to	cut	it	on	the	bias	so
that	it	is	tender.	I	like	a	hanger	steak	served	with	a	traditional	sauce,	such	as	a	caramelized	shallot	and	red
wine	sauce	or	a	bourbon	peppercorn	sauce.	It	is	important	to	caramelize	the	shallots	so	they	get	sweet	and
offset	the	gaminess	of	the	steak.	I	use	bourbon	instead	of	cognac	because	it	has	more	punch	to	it,	and	I’ll
use	four	different	peppercorns	—	white,	black,	pink,	and	green	—	with	the	last	two	modulating	the	flavor.
Green	peppercorns	have	the	sharpness	to	cut	through	the	richness.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Rib	steak	is	the	most	popular	cut	next	to	filet	mignon.	The	cut	comes	from	the	rib	roast,	where	one	end
meets	the	chuck	at	the	fattier	end	and	the	other	meets	the	short	loin	at	the	leaner	end.	The	rib	steak	that
meets	the	chuck	end	is	the	most	popular	and	can	even	have	a	big	knot	of	fat	in	it.	This	is	one	of	my
favorite	steaks.	A	big,	fatty,	juicy	rib	steak	can’t	be	beat	on	the	grill.	I	cook	these	bone-on	because	it	gives
more	beef	flavor.	We	do	a	Brandt	Ranch	cut	that	comes	from	California	just	north	of	Mexico.	That	area
has	lots	of	flavor	influences,	so	I	choose	to	do	a	chili	rub	on	the	steak.	The	cut	is	Holstein,	which	haa
sweeter	edge	to	its	meat.	We	grill	it	so	that	fat	melts	away	and	bastes	it	as	it	cooks.	At	the	end,	we	brush	it
with	a	blend	of	ancho	chili,	light	brown	sugar,	toasted	ground	cumin	seeds,	chipotle	chile,	and	a	pinch	of
cayenne.	Then	we	char	it	one	more	time,	so	that	is	like	reseasoning	the	meat.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

The	sirloin	is	a	good,	beefy-flavored	high-quality	cut.	It	is	a	cut	toward	the	back	of	the	animal	that	gets
more	work,	so	it	is	a	little	chewy,	but	it	is	a	good-quality	steak	for	barbecuing.	If	this	cut	is	quickly
cooked	over	high	heat	on	a	grill,	not	overcooked,	and	sliced	correctly	on	the	bias,	you	are	going	to	get	the
most	out	of	it.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	you	see	rare	roast	beef,	it	is	top	round.	It	is	a	little	tough,	and	that	is	why	you

see	roast	beef	always	sliced	so	thin.	Nothing	beats	top	round	for	a	good	old-fashioned
roast	beef	sandwich	because	it	doesn’t	have	any	gristle	or	fat	—	just	good,	beefy	flavor.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	I	was	in	Ireland,	I	swilled	Guinness	[stout]	and	ate	bangers	and	mash,	which	was	essentially
sausage	with	caramelized	onions	on	top.	It	was	so	good	that	when	I	came	back	to	the	U.S.,	I	started
experimenting	with	Guinness.	That’s	how	I	came	up	with	a	dish	of	braised	short	ribs	that	had	been
marinated	in	Guinness.	The	problem	you	often	have	cooking	with	beer	is	that	sometimes	the	dish	gets
bitter.	So,	to	counteract	that	naturally	without	using	sugar,	I	choose	to	use	onions.	I	marinate	the	ribs	in	the
beer,	then	braise	them,	and	finish	the	dish	with	a	puree	of	roasted	onions	for	balance.

—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

People	love	fresh	beets.	Now	I	won’t	lay	claim	to	inventing	beet	salad	with	Gorgonzola	and	hazelnuts,
but	how	our	version	is	different	from	many	others	is	that	we	marinate	the	beets.	Overnight,	we’ll	marinate
peeled	beets	in	Barolo	vinegar,	shallots,	olive	oil,	salt,	and	pepper.	Using	Russian	and	Polish	cooking
principles,	marinating	the	beets	ensures	that	the	vinegar	is	able	to	penetrate	them	so	that	they	are	sure	to
be	tangy.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	wanted	to	take	beets	that	are	associated	with	winter	and	make	them	into	something	summery,	so	I	used
them	for	a	ceviche.	We	roasted	and	pureed	them	with	lime	and	froze	them	into	a	sorbet.	We	served	the
beet	sorbet	flat	in	a	bowl	so	it	looked	like	soup.	From	there,	we	layered	thinly	sliced	raw	bay	scallops


with	segments	of	lime,	cilantro,	and	red	onion	oil.	The	dish	is	very	fresh	tasting.	The	other	key	to	this	dish
was	that	we	had	all	the	flavors	of	ceviche	but	did	not	marinate	the	scallops	in	the	acid,	which	makes	them
rubbery.	The	scallops	treated	this	way	are	more	delicate,	like	sushi.

—	Thierry	Rautureau,	Rover’s	(Seattle)

We	serve	a	salad	that	showcases	the	classic	combination	of	beets,	walnuts,	and	orange.	We	boil	our
beets,	then	slice	them	thinly	on	the	plate.	We	add	frisée	to	the	salad	and,	since	it	is	bitter,	we	mix	in
Cambozola	cheese	and	candied	walnuts.	We	dress	the	salad	with	a	sherry-walnut-tarragon	vinaigrette,
and	a	mandarin	orange	sauce.	People	are	surprised	when	they	eat	the	dish	—	first,	because	they	find	out
they	like	beets,	and	second,	because	the	frisée	is	not	bitter	after	being	softened	by	the	sweet	touches.
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

I	like	to	intensify	the	flavor	of	beets	by	serving	them	prepared	in	different	ways	on	the	same	dish,	such	as
accenting	roasted	beets	with	crunchy	beet	chips	and	a	spiced	beet	coulis.	And	I	love	anything	anise-

—	JOSÉ	ANDRÉS,	CAFÉ	ATLÁNTICO	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

A	lot	of	people	find	the	skin	a	turnoff	on	green	bell	peppers,	so	I’ll	peel	them	and	cook	them,	which
releases	their	juice.	They’re	great	cooked	down	with	chorizo,	garlic,	and	onions,	which	you	can	serve
with	shrimp	over	rice.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

that	they	become	caramelized	and	intense.	The	bell	peppers	eventually	turn	into	a	concentrated	red	pepper
paste.	If	you	have	a	dish	where	something	is	missing,	add	a	little	of	this	and	it	will	fix	it!	It	issuperb.	I

BITTERNESS

Taste:	bitter
Function:	cooling;	stimulates	appetite;	promotes	other	tastes
Tips:	Bitterness	relieves	thirst.

When	a	bitter	component	is	added	to	a	dish,	it	creates	a	sense	of	lightness.
The	hotter	the	food	or	drink,	the	less	the	perception	of	bitterness.

So	many	Western	cultures	don’t	incorporate	bitterness	into	their	food.	In	India	and	Asia,	it	is	a
component	of	a	balanced	dish.	If	you	give	most	of	America	rice	with	lime	pickle,	they	will	not	be	thrilled.
It	will	be	too	sour,	bitter,	and	spicy.	To	introduce	the	bitter	flavor	of	lime	pickle,	we	will	puree	it	with
yogurt	and	use	it	for	a	marinade	for	whole	prawns.	That	way,	it	isn’t	overwhelming.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	used	to	love	dishes	that	were	rich	on	rich	—	but	the	older	I	get,	the	more	I	look	forward	to	that
bitterness,	the	cleansing	bite	that	makes	you	want	to	go	back	for	your	next	forkful	of	a	dish.	Almost	every
dish	in	our	kitchen	is	finished	with	some	kind	of	bitter	leaf	to	serve	as	a	balancing	component.	That’s	why
I	serve	cress	or	watercress	with	a	steak	and	potato	dish,	and	arugula	with	our	seared	bluefin	tuna	on
braised	veal	cheeks,	and	a	bed	of	bitter	greens	like	watercress,	frisée,	arugula,	and	shaved	endive	as	the
base	for	our	foie	gras	dish	—	to	cut	the	richness.

BRINED	DISHES

Taste:	salty
Tips:	Brining	meats	(i.e.,	in	salt	water)	before	cooking	increases	their	moistness,	juiciness,	and

I	don’t	brine	automatically.	If	I	have	a	chicken	that	I	know	will	cook	up	on	the	dry	side,	then	I	will	brine	it
first.	If	it	is	a	great	chicken	that	will	cook	up	naturally	juicy	and	doesn’t	need	help,	then	I	won’t.	You	can
make	a	pretty	strong	brine	for	squab	or	even	chicken	—	for	instance,	with	thyme	or	even	chile	pepper	—
and	the	meat	will	pick	up	some	flavors,	but	it’s	still	very	subtle.

BRUNCH

Customers	are	picky	at	brunch.	They	have	all	cooked	what	they	think	they	like,	they	think	they	can	do	it
slightly	better	than	we	can,	and	they	want	it	twice	as	fast.	So,	we	take	the	classics	like	pancakes	or	French
toast,	use	them	as	building	blocks,	and	push	them	a	little	further.

We	will	offer	seasonal	pancakes.	In	the	winter,	we’ll	make	buckwheat	pancakes	with	cinnamon	and

glazed	oranges.	Bridging	spring	into	summer,	we’ll	offer	corn	and	saffron	pancakes	with	a	spicy	poached
pear	and	fresh	ricotta.	Saffron	and	corn	work	really	well	together	because	of	the	floral	nature	of	the
saffron	and	sweetness	of	the	corn.	We	will	use	poached	pears	on	the	pancakes	until	switching	to
blueberries	for	the	summer,	which	give	a	real	pop.	The	pears	are	poached	in	a	red	wine	syrup	with
aleppo	chile	that	is	a	sun-dried	chile	with	a	rich,	round,	sweet	spice	to	it.	The	chile	is	not	noticeable,	but
it	acts	like	an	acid	by	lightening,	plus	cutting	the	sugar	and	richness	of,	the	pancake.

When	people	eat	pancakes,	they	naturally	reach	for	butter.	I	don’t	serve	butter	with	my	pancakes	and
instead	serve	fresh	ricotta.	We	use	ricotta	from	Anne	Saxelby,	who	supplies	us	with	a	fresh,	rich,	velvety
ricotta,	and	this	gives	a	richness	to	the	dish.

Butterscotch-Praline	Ice	Cream	Parfait
—	Rebecca	Charles,	Pearl	Oyster	Bar	(New	York	City)

One	of	my	favorite	flavors	in	the	world	is	brown	butter.	A	financier	cake	made	with	brown	butter	is	one
of	the	best	things	ever.	I	have	been	making	a	brown	butter	vinaigrette	for	a	jillion	years!	It	is	a	super-easy
pan	sauce	that	I	love	as	a	warm	sauce:	I	just	brown	my	butter	in	a	pan	until	it	gets	the	noisette	[brown]


color,	then	add	some	balsamic	vinegar.	It	doesn’t	even	need	to	be	expensive	balsamic.	You	make	an
emulsification	in	the	pan,	and	add	a	little	salt	and	pepper	and	it’s	done.	The	flavor	of	brown	butter,	salt,
and	acid	is	one	of	my	favorites.	It	works	well	on	different	fish	like	scallops	or	halibut	or	soft-shell	crabs.
—	TRACI	DES	JARDINS,	JARDINIÈRE	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Brown	butter	is	one	of	my	favorite	flavors,	and	it	pairs	well	with	anything	nutty,	as	well	as	richer	fruits
like	bananas.	A	classic	French	financier	is	hands-down	one	of	my	favorite	French	pastries	[a	cookie
made	with	brown	butter,	egg	whites,	flour,	and	powdered	sugar].

Butter	tastes	great	on	its	own,	and	in	making	brown	butter	you	are	not	adding	anything	to	it	—	just
transforming	it,	so	that	it	becomes	more.	The	process	is	simple	but	a	little	tricky,	as	it	keeps	cooking	even
after	it	is	off	the	stove.	Something	you	can	do	to	improve	it	is	—	halfway	through	the	cooking	process	—
start	whisking	the	butter,	because	it	intensifies	the	flavor	if	you	keep	the	particles	suspended.

Cabbage	often	has	the	connotation	of	being	heavy,	but	in	the	fall,	we’ll	make	a	fine	chiffonade	of	cabbage


that’s	very	light.	I	like	to	cut	cabbage	thin	and	roast	it	in	a	pan	so	that	the	edges	just	get	brown	because
that	tastes	really	good.	We	figured	that	out	by	mistake	by	putting	cabbage	into	too	hot	a	pan.	After	the	chef
raised	his	voice	about	how	that	is	the	wrong	way	to	cook	cabbage,	we	tasted	it,	and	it	was	good!	We	now
serve	a	green	cabbage	dish	cooked	this	way	with	caraway	seeds	and	walnuts,	then	deglazed	with
Calvados.	We	also	add	a	little	cider	vinegar	and	olive	oil	to	finish.	It	is	a	nice,	easy	marriage.	It	is	noan
unpredictable	marriage;	these	things	just	all	work	together.	We	pair	this	with	braised	pork	belly,	but	it
would	also	work	with	a	roasted	breast	of	squab	with	its	leg	done	in	a	confit.

Thumbelina	carrots	are	something	I	missed	when	I	moved	from	working	in	the	country	[i.e.,	Pocantico
Hills,	New	York,	where	Blue	Hill	at	Stone	Barns	is	located]	into	Manhattan.	Luckily,	I	recently	found
these	short,	fat	carrots	at	the	green	market.	We	sauté	these	carrots	over	an	open	fire	so	that	they	get	a	little
smoky.	When	they	are	cooked,	they	become	soft	and	creamy.	Once	cooked,	we	turn	them	into	a	puree	with
a	shot	of	carrot	juice	at	the	last	second.	We	pair	this	with	farro	that	has	been	cooked	like	risotto,	then	add
some	pine	nuts	and	more	Thumbelina	carrots	that	have	been	quartered.	I	don’t	know	what	is	more
seductive:	the	smooth	carrot	farro	with	its	light	carrot	flavor	or	the	carrots	themselves	that	are	totally
creamy.	The	dish	has	no	butter	or	cream	but	that	is	not	because	we	are	trying	to	be	healthy.	The	dish	just
doesn’t	need	it.
—	MICHAEL	ANTHONY,	GRAMERCY	TAVERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Juices	are	a	great	way	to	freshen	up	a	dish.	If	you	cook	a	carrot,	you	lose	the	“carrotiness”	of	it.	If	you
make	a	carrot	soup	with	cooked	carrots,	it	doesn’t	become	bright.	So	now	we	do	a	carrot	base	with


cooked	organic	carrots	with	tops,	onions,	garlic,	and	maybe	some	ginger	and	lemongrass.	With	that	base
we	make	a	really	thick	soup	and	then	add	carrot	juice	to	it.	In	the	end	you	have	fresh	and	cooked	carrots
for	a	better	flavor	profile.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	had	a	salad	at	a	restaurant	with	grated	carrots	and	tarragon	leaves	with	pistachios	—	and	I	knew	the
minute	I	tasted	it	that	I	could	adapt	this	salad	to	be	my	own.	Instead	of	grating	the	carrots,	I	cut	them	onthe
bias	and	roasted	them	with	a	little	ginger	and	juca	[an	African	mix	made	of	almonds,	pistachios,
hazelnuts,	and	spices].	To	finish	the	salad,	I	added	the	whole	tarragon	leaves,	great	pistachio	oil,	and	a
raita	of	yogurt	and	golden	raisins.	The	dish	has	wonderful	colors	and	texture	and	those	beautiful	whole
leaves	of	tarragon	which	I	had	never	thought	to	do	myself.
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

Carrots	—	which	pair	well	with	allspice,	cinnamon,	cloves,	and	cumin	—	are	one	of	the	few	vegetables
that	shine	in	desserts.	When	I	first	came	to	the	U.S.	I	discovered	carrot	cake	and	that	you	could	use	carrots
for	dessert.	I	have	since	made	carrot	ice	cream,	cookies,	and	fruit	paste.	The	problem	is	that	most	people
trust	carrot	cake	but	little	else.	When	I	am	using	carrots	for	dessert,	I	like	to	cook	them	with	orange.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

he	used	them	together	in	a	soup.	I	didn’t	grow	up	liking	cauliflower,	but	I	do	now	when	it’s	well	roasted
or	pureed.	It	has	good	water	content,	which	makes	for	a	very	smooth	puree,	and	it	has	a	subtle	yet	distinct
flavor.	Apple	combines	well	with	both,	as	it	adds	acidity	and	crunch	while	cutting	the	stronger	flavors.

you	need	all	the	vegetables	—	but	if	I	could	have	only	one,	it	would	be	celery.	I	love	its	earthy	flavor.
Celery	and	black	truffles	are	my	favorite	combination.	They	work	in	part	because	they	come	out	of	the
ground	at	the	same	time	of	year.	Any	root	vegetable	also	works	with	celery.	I	enjoy	celery	root	and	celery

Since	cheese	is	a	near-perfect	food,	I	sometimes	look	for	the	few	nutrients	missing	in	cheese	that	can	be
found	in	other	foods.	The	two	essential	nutrients	that	cheese	does	not	provide	are	vitamin	C	and	fiber.
This	recommends	fruits	especially	—	and	makes	a	great	start	to	the	day:	cheese,	some	high-fiber	vitamin
C–rich	fruit,	some	whole	grain	organic	bread,	and	coffee.	The	breads	I	prefer	with	cheese	are	usually
neutral	flavored,	though	I	fully	appreciate	the	nutty	or	herbed	or	fruity	breads	as	natural	partners	for
cheeses.	The	main	reason	I	prefer	neutral	flavors	in	my	breads	is	because	I	don’t	want	to	meddle	with	the
flavors	in	the	cheeses	themselves.	I’m	kind	of	a	purist	on	that!	Usually,	the	softer	the	cheese,	the	harder	the


bread	—	to	an	extent.	And	high-pectin,	high-fiber	fruits	[e.g.,	apples,	pears,	apricots,	plums,	nectarines,
peaches,	figs]	make	natural	accompaniments	for	many,	many	cheeses.

Which	cheeses?	My	faves	with	my	espresso	to	which	I	add	a	little	unfiltered	raw	honey	would	be	the
pressed	sheep	milk	cheeses:	Ossau	Iraty,	Roncal,	Zamorano,	Berkswell,	Spenwood,	Trade	Lake	Cedar,
Vermont	Shepherd,	manchego,	or	Pecorino	Foglie	Noce.	But	I’m	happy	with	whatever	is	looking	good,
and	preferably	the	harder	aged	cheeses:	sheep,	goat,	or	cow.
—	MAX	McCALMAN,	ARTISANAL	CHEESE	CENTER	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

With	aged	or	strong	cheese,	you	need	something	fruity	or	sweet	to	contrast	with	the	strong	flavor.
Pecorino	is	very	strong,	so	you	need	something	sweet	with	it.	With	an	aged	or	hard	cheese,	I	like	to	serve
some	chestnut	honey,	a	fruit	jam,	or	watermelon	confiture.	If	I	have	some	aged	goat	cheese,	I	like	a
mostarda	[Italian	mustard	fruit].	With	sharper	cheese,	I	also	like	a	nice	sweet	wine,	especially	an	Italian
Passito.	With	fresh	young	cheese,	I	simply	like	some	good	bread.	Chestnut	honey,	while	good	with	aged
cheese,	does	not	work	with	a	young	cheese.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Honey,	jam,	and	mostarda	go	great	with	cheese.	Most	honey	works	best	with	younger	cheeses	and	soft-
ripened	cheeses,	especially	if	they	have	a	chalky	quality	to	them.	I	love	mountain	Gorgonzola	with
chestnut	honey;	it	is	crazy!	In	Italy,	we	call	jam	a	confitura	or	marmalata.	I	like	it	with	saltier	cheeses
like	Parmesan,	or	with	more	assertive	cheeses.	Mostarda	is	made	of	fruits	cooked	in	a	white	wine
mustard	syrup	until	they	are	candied.	So,	you	have	a	sweet	candy	effect	with	the	spicy	mustard.	It	goes
with	any	savory	firm	cheese,	and	particularly	well	with	pecorino	and	Taleggio.

If	you	are	going	to	make	a	dessert	with	cheese,	you	want	it	to	be	a	softer	cheese.	I	make	a	goat	cheese
cake	with	berries	and	for	that	I	use	a	milder	goat	cheese.	Goat	cheese	and	lemon	work	really	well
together,	because	the	acidity	of	the	lemon	juice	cuts	the	fat	of	the	goat	cheese.

If	you	open	my	refrigerator	at	home,	you	will	always	find	a	piece	of	cheese!	I	love	many	cheeses,	but
there	will	definitely	be	a	piece	of	Parmigiano-Reggiano.	It	never	goes	bad	and	is	so	versatile.	I	can	cut	a
piece	off	to	go	with	a	glass	of	Prosecco	as	an	apéritif,	serve	it	after	dinner	with	red	wine,	slice	a	piece
for	a	sandwich,	or	grate	it	over	some	pasta.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	was	in	Parma,	Italy,	in	a	restaurant	and	out	came	my	glass	of	Prosecco	followed	by	the	server	cutting	off
hunks	of	Parmigiano-Reggiano	to	serve	me.	I	thought	it	was	a	beautiful	way	to	begin!	It	is	a	way	to	leave
your	world	behind,	and	begin	your	meal.

Gina	DePalma	of	New	York’s	Babbo	on	Babbo’s	Cheese
Plate
At	Babbo,	I	oversee	the	cheese	selection,	which	has	seven	choices.	The	biggest	challenge
with	Italian	cheese	is	that	there	are	so	many	“superstars”	that	you	just	can’t	not	offer	them.
So,	in	the	seven	slots	we	have	many	standard	choices	but	they	are	amazing:

•	Parmigiano-Reggiano:	This	is	the	“undisputed	king	of	all	cheeses”	according	to	Mario	[Batali]!

•	Taleggio:	This	washed-rind	cheese	is	very	wet,	has	the	distinctive	orange	color,	and	is	gooey.	The
interior	is	sweet	and	the	rind	is	assertive.

•	Gorgonzola	Piccante:	This	is	firmer,	bluer,	nutty,	and	just	amazing!

•	Coach	Farm	Goat:	Though	it	is	not	from	Italy,	it	is	the	goat	cheese	we	choose.	[Mario	Batali’s
wife’s	family	owns	the	Coach	Farm	Dairy.]

•	Robiola:	This	is	a	soft-ripened	cheese	from	Piedmont.

•	Pecorino:	This	is	a	sheep’s	milk	cheese	that	is	nothing	like	the	Pecorino-Romano	that	you	get	in
your	deli	to	grate	over	pasta.	This	is	made	in	many	areas	around	Italy.	We	may	use	one	from	the	south
or	Tuscany	or	one	that	is	rubbed	with	tomato	or	aged	underground	from	another	part	of	the	country.
•	The	Seventh	Cheese:	I	play	around	with	the	seventh	cheese	and	change	it	often	but	a	recent
favorite	is	a	Piave,	which	is	like	an	English	Cheddar.	It	is	from	the	Veneto	along	the	Piave	River.

Cherries	can	stand	up	to	a	lot	of	flavors.	They	have	more	juice	to	them	as	well	as	complexity.	Almonds	go

chocolate	works	with	cherries	as	well.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

If	you	have	perfect	ingredients	in	the	summertime,	you	don’t	have	to	do	much	to	them.	With	our	perfect
cherries	[Michigan,	while	at	Tribute	restaurant],	we	halved	them,	sprinkled	them	with	sugar,	and	heated
them	with	a	blowtorch	so	that	they	were	just	warmed	through.	The	slightly	caramelized	sugar	made	a	huge
difference	in	the	flavor.	I	used	a	goat	cream	cheese	worked	to	a	texture	similar	to	mascarpone	cheese,
which	I	shaped	into	quenelles.	Served	alongside	were	some	ice	wine	vinegar	caramel	sauce	and	a	crispy
crepe.	Before	serving,	I	added	individual	thyme	leaves	and	a	crack	of	black	pepper.	These	are	all	really


classic	flavors,	especially	the	cheese	with	black	pepper	and	cherries.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	was	reading	an	old	Fannie	Farmer	cookbook	from	the	late	1800s	about	making	cherry	jam.	In	the	recipe,
they	would	take	the	cherry	pits	and	crush	them.	I	thought	it	was	crazy	but	tried	it.	When	you	take	cherry
pits	and	crush	them,	it	gives	you	an	almond	flavor.	I	made	some	pickled	sour	cherries	with	the	crushed
pits	in	cheesecloth	with	the	pickling	liquid	and	I	got	this	great	almondy	flavor	that	went	deep	inside	the
cherries.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	like	to	let	them	shine	on	their	own.	But	I	do	really	like	cherries	and	grappa.	Mario	[Batali]	has	a	home
in	Michigan	and	he	brought	me	back	a	case	of	cherries.	They	were	so	perfect	I	just	macerated	them	in
grappa	and	torn	mint	leaves.	I	served	them	in	a	bowl	with	a	dollop	of	mascarpone.	Cherries	also	work
well	with	mint.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	loved	cherries	so	much	growing	up	that	I	would	climb	up	our	cherry	tree	and	eat	as	many	as	I	could.
Then	I	would	realize	I	didn’t	know	how	to	get	back	down	and	would	cry	until	the	neighbors	would	get	me
down.	I	still	love	cherries	and	especially	in	cherry	pie	or	a	clafoutis.	Cherries	work	well	with	vanilla	or
poached	in	red	wine,	but	I	like	to	keep	them	as	simple	as	possible.

bits	of	candied	chestnuts.	This	was	then	set	on	an	orange-soaked	chestnut	sponge	cake,	next	to	a	chestnut
wafer	and	chestnut	paste.	I	needed	a	complementary	flavor,	and	I	have	always	liked	the	combination	of
pear	and	chestnut.	They	both	have	a	richness	but	depending	on	how	the	pear	is	handled,	it	can	add
freshness	and	acidity.	I	roasted	the	pear	in	sugar,	butter,	and	ice	wine	vinegar	and	finished	it	in	the	oven
until	soft.	The	pear	was	then	diced	tartare-like	and	had	orange	confit	added.	The	juices	from	the	pear
were	the	only	sauce.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Chestnuts	have	a	bursty	flavor	and	they	work	with	chocolate	and	pears.	You	have	to	combine	them	with
earthy	flavors.	If	you	paired	chestnuts	with	berries,	they	would	just	get	lost.

Red	beans	and	rice	with	andouille	sausage	is	my	favorite!	When	we	opened	up	after	the	hurricane
[Katrina]	and	were	serving	on	paper	plates,	I	made	a	roasted	Tabasco	chicken	served	with	dirty	rice,
with	the	sausage	stuffed	in	a	bell	pepper	alongside	red	bean	puree.	For	another	dish,	I	was	inspired	by	a
diner	down	the	street	from	us	that	had	chicken	and	waffles	on	the	menu,	which	is	an	old	Southern	dish.	My
take	is	to	make	a	savory	waffle	and	to	add	Boursin	cheese	with	lots	of	herbs.	Then	I	pair	it	with	chicken
thighs	braised	in	a	coq	au	vin	blanc	and	serve	it	with	spinach.	The	dish	is	simple,	but	I	just	love	the
flavors.

Andrew	Carmellini	of	New	York’s	A	Voce	on	Cooking
Chicken	as	a	Two-Part	Process	—	and	Applying	It	to
Chicken	Cacciatore

1.	Brining:	Sometimes	the	older	techniques	inspire	me	for	deeper	flavors.	Many	of	these	techniques
are	overlooked.	Take	brining,	for	instance.	Brining	has	been	done	forever	with	pork	chops	and	chicken,
and	for	the	last	five	years	you	have	heard	about	it	with	turkey.	The	success	of	brining	is	more	about	the
salt	and	it	getting	in	there	and	softening	the	protein	strands.	It	is	less	about	all	the	other	flavoring	agents.

If	you	want	to	get	started	in	your	kitchen,	start	with	a	skin-	and	bone-on	chicken	breast.	Grab	some
kosher	salt,	sugar,	or	honey	as	I	do,	some	water,	and	brine	the	breast	for	30	minutes.	When	you	pull	it	out
of	the	brine,	rinse	it,	dry	it,	and	let	it	sit	in	the	refrigerator	for	a	couple	of	hours	so	the	moisture	comes	out.
You	will	notice	the	difference	in	the	texture.	The	marinated	chicken	—	even	if	you	overcook	it	—	will	not
be	dry.	It	is	the	best.

2.	Marinating:	The	chicken	on	my	menu	right	now	is	brined	and	then	marinated	for	24	hours.	It	is

crazy	how	good	the	chicken	becomes.	The	marinade	is	made	up	of	roasted	garlic,	Sicilian	oregano,	red
pepper	flakes,	lots	of	lemon,	thyme,	and	olive	oil.	We	joke	that	it	tastes	like	Zesty	Italian	Wish-Bone
Dressing.	It	is	so	delicious.

The	finished	dish	is	served	with	poached	and	sautéed	artichoke,	roasted	pepper	grilled	over	wood,
fennel,	and	roasted	spring	onions.	These	vegetables	are	all	tossed	with	pesto,	and	the	dish	is	finished	with
a	tomato	sauce	made	with	foamy	tomato	water	and	thyme.

Chicken	Cacciatore
We	opened	up	A	Voce	with	chicken	cacciatore	on	our	menu	and	when	people	heard	the
name	of	the	dish,	they’d	just	yawn.	A	lot	of	times,	this	dish	is	just	chicken	scaloppine	with
peppers	and	tomatoes.	Ours	is	a	whole	different	dish:	the	chicken	is	on	the	bone,	and
brined	first,	which	makes	it	nice	and	moist.	With	it,	we	serve	a	homemade	peperonata	with
roasted	peppers,	onions,	garlic,	red	pepper	flakes,	rosemary,	fresh	bay	leaf,	fresh	thyme,
and	piment	d’Espelette	[a	pepper	from	France	with	a	smoky	flavor].	Here	is	a	place	where
technique	plays	a	role	in	the	flavor:	When	you	roast	peppers,	the	best	way	to	get	the	skin
off	is	to	put	them	in	a	bowl	covered	with	plastic	wrap	and	let	them	steam.	When	they	are
done,	you	are	left	with	the	pepper	liquid.	What	we	do	is	cook	with	that	liquid.

To	finish	this	dish,	we	put	a	big	scoop	of	the	pepper	mixture,	tomato	sauce,	garlic
puree,	onion,	red	wine	vinegar,	and	fresh	bay	leaf	on	the	chicken	and	put	it	in	the	oven	to
roast.	The	chicken	cooks	in	its	own	juice	then	is	served	with	roasted	potatoes.	It	is


delicious.

What	we	are	doing	is	layering	the	flavors.	You	have	the	technique	of	brining	the	chicken,

elevating	the	flavor	profile	of	the	peppers	with	the	sweetness	of	the	onions	and	herbs,
adding	a	little	heat	from	the	piment	d’Espelette,	and	giving	body	to	the	sauce	from	the
pepper	juice,	which	is	distilled	pepper	brandy.

My	chocolate-corn	dessert	[of	soft	chocolate	ganache	and	sweet	corn	in	three	textures:	crunchy	corn	and
hazelnut	corn	sorbet,	and	corn	tuile]	was	inspired	by	freeze-dried	corn.	[The	kernels]	are	whole	with	a
vibrant	sweetness.	Corn	dates	back	to	the	Aztecs,	who	also	loved	chocolate,	so	it’s	funny	when	people
ask,	“Where’d	you	get	the	inspiration?”	This	starts	with	a	layer	of	milk	chocolate	hazelnut	praline	paste,
then	the	corn,	and	then	crushed	wafers	that	give	it	that	Kit	Kat	candy	bar	texture;	on	top	of	that	is	some
chocolate	ganache,	then	a	layer	of	chocolate.	To	play	off	those	flavors	I	serve	some	espelette	[pepper]	to
give	a	little	heat	and	some	smoked	salt	from	Wales.	This	dish	is	about	the	interplay	of	the	chocolate	and
the	corn.	The	espelette	gives	a	heat	that	reminds	me	of	roasted	corn	salsa.	This	is	an	ode	to	the	origin	of
the	inspiration.

It	is	hard	to	think	of	a	fruit	or	nut	that	is	not	improved	by	combining	it	with	chocolate.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	love	chocolate	with	fruit	or	nuts	or	both.	My	favorite	candy	bar	in	the	world	is	a	Cadbury	Fruit	and	Nut


bar.	On	my	menu	I	have	a	chocolate,	hazelnut,	and	orange	dessert,	which	is	essentially	a	Cadbury!
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	it	comes	to	chocolate,	keep	it	simple.	That’s	always	good	advice!	For	simplicity	at	its	best,	only
two	ingredients	are	necessary:	heavy	cream	and	chopped	chocolate.	Bring	the	cream	to	a	boil,	pour	it
over	the	chocolate,	and	it	turns	into	ganache.	Serve	it	warm	with	just	a	spoon.	How	can	you	do	any	better?
In	my	new	book,	I	feature	a	recipe	called	Cup	O’	Dark	Chocolate,	and	essentially	it	is	ganache	poured
into	a	cup.	Then	you	grab	a	cookie,	and	have	at	it!

If	you	want	to	dip	fruit	into	chocolate,	dried	fruits	such	as	figs,	pear,	and	pineapple	all	work	really
well.	People	always	ask	what	they	can	serve	to	impress	their	sweetheart	on	Valentine’s	Day,	and	fresh
strawberries	are	really	nice	in	February.	Just	make	a	warm	ganache,	grab	the	strawberries,	and	start
dipping.	Fresh	grapes	are	fantastic	with	chocolate.	Dip	them	into	the	melted	chocolate,	pop	them	in	the
freezer,	and	when	they	are	frozen,	put	them	into	a	two-quart	container.	That	way,	you	will	always	have	a
little	treat	in	the	freezer.	Be	careful	though	—	they	are	not	M&Ms,	so	they	will	melt	in	your	hands!

Everybody	is	on	the	chocolate	bandwagon	now,	and	we	are	not	far	away	from	the	proverbial	“man	on	the
street”	knowing	the	difference	between	a	72	percent	and	a	66	percent	chocolate.	The	boutique	chocolate
makers	are	now	coming	up	with	estate	and	varietal	and	vintage	chocolates.	I	love	that,	but	honestly,	once
you	add	enough	sugar	and	cream	to	chocolate,	those	nuances	are	all	gone.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

People	always	ask	why	I	use	bittersweet	versus	semisweet	chocolate.	Semisweet	is	chocolate	that	needs
salt.	When	you	add	salt	to	it,	it	brings	up	the	bitter	flavor	and	makes	it	taste	bittersweet.	Semisweet
chocolate	to	me	tastes	kind	of	flat.	Milk	chocolate	can	taste	flat	as	well.	Now	that	there	is	Scharffen
Berger	and	El	Rey	on	the	market,	I	find	both	those	chocolates	to	be	really,	really	great,	with	both	flavor
and	kick	to	them.	But	if	you	want	a	killer	chocolate	dessert,	don’t	use	milk	chocolate.

When	I	write	a	dessert	menu,	there	will	be	a	couple	of	chocolate	desserts,	with	one	being	a	killer

chocolate	and	the	other	a	lighter	option,	like	chocolate	with	bananas.	If	you	don’t	have	something
intensely	chocolate,	chocolate	lovers	are	very,	very	unhappy.	Banana	soufflé	with	chocolate	is	not
considered	a	chocolate	dessert.	You	have	to	be	careful	with	a	killer	chocolate	dessert	—	you	can’t	just
put	chocolate,	chocolate,	and	chocolate	together.	There	has	to	be	balance	so	the	dessert	is	not	too	rich.	To
achieve	balance,	turn	to	coffee	or	caramel	because	they	pair	so	well	and	help	to	intensify	the	chocolate
flavor.

For	some	desserts,	I	like	to	combine	white	and	dark	chocolate,	or	milk	and	dark	chocolate,	to	give
balance	and	cut	intensity.	It	sounds	crazy,	but	you	can	use	one	chocolate	to	mellow	the	flavor	of	another.
I’m	not	a	fan	of	herbs	with	dessert,	with	the	possible	exception	of	chocolate.	I	love	the	combination

of	chocolate	with	mint.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	don’t	have	a	big	sweet	tooth	but	I	do	like	all	kinds	of	chocolate,	from	dark	to	white.	Each	one	is
completely	different.	I	like	the	bitterness	and	clean	flavor	of	dark	chocolate.	I	like	milk	chocolate	with	a
piece	of	bread	like	when	I	was	a	kid.	You	have	to	select	your	white	chocolate	carefully	because	not	all	of
it	is	good.	White	chocolate	works	well	in	a	mousse;	it	has	a	more	neutral	flavor	and	does	not	dictate.
Dark	chocolate	is	all	about	being	the	star,	versus	white,	that	is	better	to	play	with.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Dark	chocolate	goes	really	well	with	coffee	or	caramel,	but	if	I	could	only	pick	one	it	would	be	the
caramel!	Caramel	and	chocolate	play	so	well	together	despite	both	being	strong	flavors.

I	make	a	cake	with	dark	cocoa,	which	makes	for	a	bitter	chocolate	flavor,	and	then	in	the	middle	a	milk


chocolate	cream.	Many	people	don’t	realize	how	great	the	chocolate	flavor	of	cocoa	is.	It	adds	bitterness
and	intensity	without	adding	richness.	That	is	invaluable	because	so	many	chocolate	desserts	are	so	rich.
Often	when	I	make	a	chocolate	ice	cream,	I	will	combine	melted	chocolate	and	cocoa.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

My	dessert	of	milk	chocolate	pot	de	crème,	caramel	foam,	maple	syrup,	and	Maldon	sea	salt	served	in	an
emptied-out	eggshell	symbolizes	that	a	few	ingredients	can	come	together	in	a	way	that	is	greater	than	the
sum	of	their	parts.	The	key	ingredient	which	ties	it	together	is	the	Maldon	sea	salt.	This	combination
elevates	all	the	ingredients.

Starting	with	chocolate,	caramel	was	the	logical	next	step.	At	the	time,	I	played	with	fleur	de	sel,	red

salt	from	Hawaii,	and	others,	before	ending	up	with	the	Maldon.	I	like	the	concept	of	using	sugar	as	a
seasoning,	beyond	its	natural	necessity	in	dessert.	I	also	like	natural	sweetness	from	things	and	maple
sugar	brings	a	lot	of	flavor	beyond	sweetness.	Once	I	hit	upon	this	combination,	I	have	never	changed	it.

Valrhona	and	El	Rey	are	both	good.	When	you	are	looking	for	a	white	chocolate,	you	want	one	that	has
some	smoothness	to	it.	It	is	not	going	to	have	the	acidity	that	dark	chocolate	has.	When	you	are	making	a
dessert	with	white	chocolate,	it	is	going	to	be	a	softer,	smoother	dessert.	I	don’t	like	dark	chocolate	and
raspberries	together,	but	I	believe	I	am	one	of	the	few	chefs	who	feel	this	way.	What	I	don’t	like	is	that
when	you	take	a	bite	of	the	chocolate	with	the	berry,	the	acidity	of	the	two	don’t	blend.	The	acids	are	too
similar,	so	it	doesn’t	feel	like	a	single	dessert	in	your	mouth.	Instead,	it	is	a	clash	with	both	of	them
bouncing	into	each	other	in	your	mouth.	They	don’t	bridge,	and	even	whipped	cream	doesn’t	bring	them
together.	But	if	you	use	white	chocolate,	its	softness	works	much	better	with	berries.	The	white	chocolate
complements	the	berries	and	brings	out	their	flavors.	Citrus,	especially	anything	in	the	orange	family,	also
works	well	with	white	chocolate.	Nuts,	such	as	almonds,	work	well	with	white	chocolate.	Spices	also
work	well	with	white	chocolate.

Use	cilantro	to	provide	a	cooling	note	to	chile	pepper–	spiced	dishes.

After	a	visit	to	Spain,	I	created	a	chorizo	broth	to	go	with	monkfish.	I	love	chorizo,	with	its	paprika
flavors	and	the	fattiness	of	the	pork.	So	I	had	to	figure	out	how	to	make	a	sauce	out	of	a	dried	piece	of
sausage.	We	melted	the	chorizo	in	a	pan	for	a	long	time,	and	ended	up	with	a	flavorful	grease	that	was	not
that	appealing.	However,	we	emulsified	it	in	an	herb-infused	clam	broth,	and	it	became	velvety.	It	wasn’t
greasy,	and	gave	the	sauce	a	little	kick.	I	chose	this	sauce	to	go	with	monkfish	because	it	is	a	meaty	fish
and	can	stand	up	to	spice	and	to	strong	flavors	really	well.	Chorizo	would	not	destroy	the	soul	of	the	fish.

—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	really	like	using	cilantro	for	its	lemony	and	floral	qualities,	even	though	it’s	very	non-European.	I’ll	put
cilantro	stems	[not	the	leaves]	in	the	cavity	when	I’m	roasting	a	chicken,	and	I	find	it	lifts	the	flavor.
Cilantro	stems	are	also	wonderful	in	Spanish-themed	stews	when	there’s	a	lot	of	depth	of	flavor	from
ingredients	like	chorizo,	chickpeas,	oxtails,	or	tripe,	and	it	needs	a	high	note.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

to	make	cilantro	oil	as	well	as	purees.	It	lends	itself	well	to	white	meats	but	I	have	even	put	it	on	hanger
steak	and	wild	boar.	I	also	like	it	with	coconut	milk.

My	coconut	rice	pudding	strudel	was	the	result	of	Takashi’s	influence.	[Takashi	Yagihashi	was	his	chef	at
Detroit’s	Tribute	restaurant.]	Dessert	has	to	make	sense	in	the	context	of	the	rest	of	the	meal.	Being	a
pastry	chef	is	exciting	because	you	have	a	lot	of	autonomy,	but	you	are	still	working	within	the	chef’s
framework.	Takashi’s	food	was	very	Asian-influenced.	This	dish	was	meant	to	bring	in	Asian	ingredients
in	a	new	way	yet	be	something	familiar.

So	we	have	rice	pudding	flavored	with	coconut,	lemongrass,	ginger,	and	vanilla,	and	diced	apricot
for	texture.	At	the	time	I	was	introduced	to	frie	de	brique,	which	is	a	Moroccan	dough	that	is	like	a	cross
between	phyllo	and	a	wonton	wrapper.	I	would	wrap	these	ingredients	in	this	dough	and	then	sauté	them
in	clarified	butter	and	slice	them	like	a	spring	roll.	Alongside	I	served	green	tea	ice	cream.	This	covered
a	lot	of	bases	for	me:	the	warm	and	cold	temperatures,	the	Asian	influence,	and	doing	something	with
boring	old	rice	pudding.

The	coolest	compliment	I	ever	got	was	from	Andrew	Carmellini	[chef	of	New	York’s	A	Voce]	who
was	sitting	down	with	us	and	asked	about	my	background.	When	I	said	I	used	to	be	a	line	cook,	he	said,	“I
knew	it	—	a	pastry	chef	would	never	come	up	with	that!”	It	was	the	combination	of	techniques	and
flavors	as	well	as	sautéing	something	to	order.

We	participate	in	an	event	called	“Plate	and	Pitchfork”	that	is	held	on	a	farm	with	the	food	from	the	farm.
The	guests	sit	in	the	field	among	the	corn	and	tomatoes,	and	we	cook	a	meal	for	them	on	a	couple	of
grills.	I	made	a	corn	soup	for	this	event.	We	removed	the	husks,	then	cut	the	kernels	off	the	cob.	Then	we
used	the	husks,	which	produce	a	juice,	to	make	a	stock	for	the	soup.	If	you	were	to	use	cobs,	you	wouldn’t
get	the	same	flavor.	It	is	important	to	keep	the	corn	flavor	pure.	Most	cooks	would	throw	in	a	bunch	of
vegetables	in	the	stock,	and	what	you’d	get	then	is	a	vegetable	stock	with	corn.	I	want	to	have	a	corny
flavor	in	the	end.	We	made	a	stock	using	the	corn	husks	cooked	with	a	little	onion,	water,	and	salt,	and	let
it	cook	for	about	45	minutes.	What	came	out	was	the	most	amazing	sweet	broth.	We	added	the	corn,
pureed	it,	and	served	it	chilled.	It	was	so	sweet	and	full	of	corn	flavor	you	would	have	sworn	there	were
cream	and	sugar	in	it.

We	now	make	a	corn	husk	broth	to	add	to	a	corn,	chanterelle,	and	Dungeness	crab	risotto	with	a	touch

of	pesto.	Basil	pesto	and	corn	really	speaks	to	me.	It	is	a	wonderful	combination.

Crab	is	something	that	you	typically	see	steamed	and	served	with	butter.	King	crab	is	intensely	flavorful,

I	did	was	soak	the	crab	multiple	times	in	ice	water	to	draw	out	all	the	salt.	I	saw	and	created	a	vision	of
this	red	crabmeat	within	a	barigoule	with	perfectly	cut	vegetables,	artichokes,	French	green	beans,
Valencia	oranges,	sweet	garlic,	and	finished	with	olive	oil.
—	CARRIE	NAHABEDIAN,	Naha	(Chicago)

When	making	crab	cakes,	I’ll	use	whole	shrimp	—	the	meat	in	the	cakes,	and	the	shrimp	heads	in	the
sauce	—	to	intensify	the	shellfish	flavor.

CREAM

Crayfish,	Beet,	Leek,	and	Bacon	Salad	with	Mustard	Vinaigrette
—	Daniel	Boulud,	at	the	2003	James	Beard	Awards	gala	reception

When	you	eat	a	piece	of	pumpkin	pie,	the	whipped	cream	is	the	first	thing	you	go	for!	You	can	take	this


for	granted	in	desserts,	or	you	can	dig	deeper:	You	can	think	of	cream	as	its	own	flavor.	When	I	was	in
Japan,	the	cream	was	miles	better	than	here	in	the	U.S.	You	also	need	to	think	about	your	dairy	choice	in
relation	to	the	country.	In	India,	everything	is	centered	around	reduced	milk.	The	counterpart	would	be
dolce	de	leche	in	Latin	cuisine.	I	love	yogurt	because	it	is	simple	and	complex;	it	can	be	in	the	forefront
or	in	the	background.

Torrijas,	which	means	“soaked,”	are	a	[custardy]	dessert	in	the	Basque	country	that	are	like	French	toast
or	pain	perdu.	We	soak	the	bread	until	it	is	saturated	in	milk,	then	let	it	sit	[in	the	refrigerator]	overnight.
The	next	morning	before	serving,	we	coat	it	in	egg	and	then	fry	it.	We	serve	our	version	of	torrijas	with
poached	apples	and	instead	of	serving	it	with	maple	syrup,	we	serve	it	with	Pedro	Ximenez	[a	rich,
sweet,	Spanish	sherry]	syrup	that	has	a	raisin-like	quality	to	it.	The	PX	is	just	warmed	and	has	a	little
glucose	added	to	thicken	it	into	a	syrup.	I	don’t	cook	it	or	reduce	it	because	I	want	to	keep	the	alcohol	in
the	syrup	so	it	doesn’t	become	overly	cloying.
—	ALEXANDRA	RAIJ,	TÍA	POL	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Daikon	is	great	in	stews	and	is	milder,	sweeter,	and	more	absorbent	than	turnips	or	radishes.	Duck	and
turnips	is	a	classic,	but	I	like	duck	with	daikon	even	better.	It	pairs	well	with	other	heavier	flavors,	such
as	pork	or	beef.

—	Monica	Pope,	T’afia	(Houston)

Someone	told	me	about	a	savory	date	dish	they	had	but	could	only	remember	that	it	was	stuffed	and
wrapped	in	bacon.	This	led	me	into	the	kitchen	to	stuff	a	date	with	chorizo,	wrap	it	in	bacon,	and	then	add
charmoula	[typically	made	of	paprika,	cayenne	pepper,	cumin,	garlic,	lemon	juice,	parsley,	cilantro,	and
olive	oil].	The	dish	just	hits	the	mark.	I	also	serve	a	sweet	date	dish	that	I	stole	from	Judy	Rodgers	of	Zuni
Café.	My	version	is	made	with	Medjool	dates	that	have	maple	mascarpone	smeared	in,	pistachios
crumbled	on	top,	and	orange	blossom	water.	The	orange	blossom	water	gives	people	a	visceral	reaction
because	you	don’t	see	it,	but	you	taste	it.	When	people	have	the	dish,	they	lick	their	fingers	trying	to	figure
it	out!
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

Emily	Luchetti	of	Farallon	in	San	Francisco	on	When	and
How	to	Serve	Dessert
The	older	I	get,	the	more	I	like	my	dessert	at	3:00	in	the	afternoon.	I	like	it	all	by	itself,	it
has	no	competition	and	you	are	usually	hungry.	Your	taste	buds	are	wide	awake	and	you
can	appreciate	what	it	is.	Of	course	if	we	have	people	over	for	dinner	I	can’t	get	away	with
not	serving	dessert!

When	you	serve	a	dessert	after	a	meal	you	are	already	full,	not	in	a	bad	way,	but	if	you
had	a	first	course	and	main	course	your	palate	has	gone	through	many	flavor	components.
At	home	I	always	take	a	little	break	and	give	people	a	breather	between	dinner	and
dessert.	I’ll	have	my	guests	help	with	the	dishes	or,	if	it’s	a	formal	party,	I’ll	let	them	talk	for
a	half	hour	and	finish	off	the	red	wine.	It	is	not	just	for	their	stomachs	but	for	the	palate	as
well.

I	hate	when	it	comes	to	slicing	a	dessert	and	someone	says,	“No,	no,	that	is	too	big!”	I
used	to	fight	it	and	take	it	personally,	so	now	I	just	ask	in	advance.	The	guest	appreciates
it,	has	a	small	piece,	and	then	has	seconds.	It	is	recognizing	that	everyone	has	their	own
choice	regarding	how	much	they	want	to	eat.	If	I	am	serving	a	shortcake,	I	will	put	the	fruit
with	a	little	cream	on	the	cake,	then	pass	a	bowl	of	whipped	cream,	so	whether	they	want
to	pile	it	or	keep	it	light,	they	can.

DESSERTS

Tips:	Sweetness	satiates	the	appetite,	so	generally	end	a	meal	on	a	sweet	note.

Even	sweet	desserts	should	be	in	balance	(their	acidity,	saltiness,	etc.).
Dessert	wine	should	always	be	sweeter	than	the	dessert	it	accompanies.

—	as	well	as	dishes	like	goulash	with	noodles,	which	is	served	with	both	chives	and	dill	for	their	herbal
freshness.

We	made	a	paella	with	the	fat	from	the	duck	and	morels,	and	to	finish	it	we	topped	it	with	thin	slices	of
raw	foie	gras.	The	foie	gras	would	get	warm	from	the	hot	rice	and	melt	into	the	rice.	It	is	an	amazing
paella!
—	JOSÉ	ANDRÉS,	CAFÉ	ATLÁNTICO	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Duck	is	great	with	fruit.	We	serve	a	duck	with	Seville	oranges	that	are	a	little	bitter.	We	made	a	puree	of
the	pulp	and	a	little	peel	that	had	nice	acidity	and	bitterness.	We	then	added	fennel	that	had	been	cooked
with	butter	and	a	little	star	anise.

For	my	dish	of	lacquered	duck	and	peppercress,	I	make	a	duck	cooked	with	honey	served	with	a	brown
butter–honey	that	gives	the	duck	a	sweet,	nutty	flavor.	To	cut	the	sweetness,	I	added	a	reduction	of
pomegranate	juice	and	oil	emulsion	to	give	the	dish	a	tart	contrast.

—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

Eggplant	can	take	on	an	even	richer,	meatier	flavor	when	it’s	enhanced	with	miso	or	tahini.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

My	eggplant	gazpacho	really	tastes	like	a	baba	ghanoush	soup.	We	start	the	soup	by	roasting	eggplant	and
onions.	Then	we	blend	this	together	with	tahini,	tomato	water,	buttermilk	for	acidity,	lemon,	and	garlic.
The	soup	is	garnished	with	three	gels	made	of	eggplant,	lemon,	and	onion	—	all	flavors	from	the	soup.	I
love	texture	—	people	joke	with	me	and	call	me	“Captain	Crunch”	—	so	at	the	last	second,	we	top	the
soup	with	Rice	Krispies.

meal.	Frittata	is	like	a	risotto	in	its	versatility;	you	can	go	crazy	with	it	and	add	almost	anything	to	them.	I
love	my	frittata	with	vegetables;	asparagus,	artichokes,	mushrooms,	onions,	zucchini	all	work.	With	any
variety	of	vegetables	I	would	add	some	fresh	herbs	and	cheese.	Since	the	eggs	are	the	protein,	the	only
thing	I	don’t	personally	care	for	in	my	frittata	is	meat,	or	maybe	pickled	vegetables.

I	have	always	loved	to	mix	meat	and	fish	in	a	very	delicate	way.	I	went	to	Cut	[Wolfgang	Puck’s	steak
restaurant]	and	had	my	first	true	Kobe	beef	steak.	I	begged	Lee	[Hefter,	the	chef]	for	his	source!	Surf	and
turf	is	not	as	much	about	having	a	piece	of	meat	and	fish	on	the	plate	as	about	the	ideas	they	create	for
flavor	combinations.	The	Kobe	beef	triggered	everything.	I	can’t	serve	steak	at	a	fish	restaurant,	but	the
Kobe	was	so	good	I	had	to	find	a	way	to	justify	it	on	the	menu.	I	came	up	with	Kobe	beef	and	escalar,
with	a	brown	butter	that	is	classic	with	the	fish.	The	final	dish	was	inspired	by	having	Korean	barbecue	at
a	friend’s	house,	which	is	when	I	realized	how	to	bring	it	together.

I	wanted	another	element	in	the	dish	because	the	Kobe,	escalar,	and	brown	butter	are	all	rich	and	all
soft.	The	dish	also	has	squash,	Japanese	pears,	and	napa	cabbage	marinated	like	Korean	kimchee	for	just
a	moment.	These	elements	add	contrast,	chewiness,	and	crunchiness.

I	like	fennel	shaved	raw,	with	just	some	lemon	juice,	olive	oil,	and	fennel	seeds.	Fennel	goes	well	with
dried	meats	like	prosciutto.	It	also	pairs	nicely	with	shellfish	like	langoustines,	lobster,	or	crab.	Fennel
can	work	with	fish	as	well	as	with	meat.	It	goes	really	well	with	cold	poached	salmon	or	white,	light
meats	like	chicken	or	veal.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Fennel	is	a	flavor	I	like	so	much	that	I	have	to	show	restraint	with	it.	You	can	add	anything	to	itbecause
other	flavors	really	adhere	to	it.	You	can	braise	it	in	olive	oil	and	veal	stock	to	get	one	flavor.	Or	you	can
braise	it	in	olive	oil,	white	wine,	and	water	and	get	a	whole	other	flavor.	Or	you	can	quarter	it,
caramelize	it,	and	roast	it	in	the	oven	—	now	you	have	a	sugar	flavor	and	it	can	become	a	dessert.	I	love
fennel	every	way	including	braised,	caramelized,	dried,	candied,	and	pureed.	In	the	fall,	I	served	raw
shaved	fennel	with	arugula,	and	shaved	Honeycrisp	apple	with	a	dressing	made	of	apple	cider,	honey,	and
mustard.	Fennel	puts	the	salad	over	the	top	with	its	crunch.	In	summer,	we	serve	a	fennel	and	fig	tarte	tatin
with	duck.	You	get	a	Fig	Newton	flavor	from	the	fig	and	Pernod	flavor	from	the	fennel;	they	match	really
well.

Fennel	pollen	has	a	light,	fennel-anise	flavor	with	a	floral	component.	It	is	delicate,	so	you	don’t	cook
with	it	—	you	just	finish	a	dish	with	it.	It	is	great	on	lighter	things	like	salads,	poached	or	steamed	flaky
white	fish,	poultry,	or	pork.	When	a	dish	has	fennel	pollen,	even	before	the	food	hits	your	mouth	you	will
notice	a	floral	smell	that	gets	you	thinking	of	summer,	lighter	foods,	and	freshness.	I	use	it	with	my	sea
trout	dish,	which	is	served	with	a	simple	salad	of	green	apple,	fennel,	jicama,	pistachios,	and	dried
gooseberries.	The	dish	is	topped	with	the	pollen	blended	with	some	yogurt,	lemon	juice,	and	preserved
lemon,	which	we	drape	over	the	fish.	This	dish	just	screams	“summer.”	With	a	glass	of	Sauvignon	Blanc
on	the	terrace	in	the	early	evening,	you’re	set!
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	really	like	fennel	pollen.	The	majority	of	the	time,	we	use	it	in	a	marinade	for	meats	like	pork,	boar,
chicken,	and	lamb.	It	adds	an	interesting	herbaceous,	aromatic	note	and	a	mysterious	flavor.

was	pliable	to	the	point	that	it	could	be	made	into	an	icing.	So,	I	created	a	savory	cake	topped	with	the

Tarte	flambéeis	a	dish	that	is	200	years	old	and	was	originally	made	by	farmers	in	Alsace	in	the	village’s
wood-burning	oven	used	for	baking	bread.	The	tarte	flambée	developed	from	what	was	on	hand	on	the
farm:	cheese	and	cream	from	the	cow,	pork	from	the	pig,	and	onions	from	the	field,	which	they	added	to
some	dough.	Since	we	don’t	have	a	wood-burning	oven	[in	the	middle	of	Manhattan],	we	have	to	tweak
the	recipe	from	the	classic.	We	have	to	tweak	the	cream	because	if	we	don’t,	it	breaks	and	just	becomes
grease.	Instead,	I	use	a	mix	of	fromage	blanc,	cream,	and	sour	cream	so	I	can	get	the	same	result	as	cream
in	the	original.	And	to	compensate	for	not	having	a	fire,	I	use	an	applewood-smoked	bacon.

Tropical	fruits	are	strong	flavored,	and	stand	up	to	chocolate	better.	At	the	same	time,	tropical	fruits	like
bananas	or	mangoes	are	not	overly	sweet	fruits,	so	caramel	can	stand	up	to	them.	With	tropical	fruits,	I
will	use	a	little	lime	juice	and	often	rum	as	well	to	help	give	them	a	little	kick.	With	mangoes,	I	use	a	little
light	brown	sugar	—	or	I’ll	even	blend	light	brown	and	white	sugar	together	because	I’ll	want	the	flavor
but	not	want	it	to	be	too	harsh.

When	garlic	needs	to	be	there,	it	needs	to	be	there.	That	includes	a	lot	of	dishes,	such	as	lamb.	Garlic	is
also	called	for	with	all	kinds	of	vegetables,	sauces,	pastas,	and	salads.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	use	garlic	primarily	in	two	ways:	infused	into	olive	oil,	or	served	crispy	as	a	garnish.	I’ll	use	the	garlic
oil	for	cooking	—	and	even	if	a	dish	will	have	garlic	added	later,	I	will	start	with	this	oil.	For	crispy
brown	garlic,	you	start	by	slicing	it	thinly	like	a	chip.	The	garlic	is	then	put	into	cold	olive	oil	and	cooked
until	it	is	just	brown.	Then,	you	add	parsley,	red	pepper	flakes,	and	an	acid	like	lemon	juice	or	vinegar	to
make	a	vinaigrette.	You	can	even	add	some	stock	like	a	fumet,	which	is	wonderful,	too	—	served	hot,	it	is
great	with	almost	any	kind	of	fish,	from	something	light	all	the	way	to	oily	blue	fish.

Cucumber	and	mint	is	a	fashionable	combination	in	cocktails,	[especially]	those	with	Hendrick’s	gin,
which	has	a	cucumber	flavor.	Cucumber	is	a	flavor	that’s	distinct	yet	delicate,	and	very	refreshing.	It	goes
beautifully	with	a	range	of	foods,	from	Asian	cuisine	to	smoked	salmon.
—	JERRI	BANKS,	COCKTAIL	CONSULTANT	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

With	gin,	or	even	Martini	&	Rossi	Bianco,	I	love	the	combination	of	blackberries	and	sage.	Blackberries

I’ll	use	ginger	more	for	its	heat	than	its	sweetness.	For	example,	I’ll	juice	it	to	add	to	a	carrot	or	squash
puree,	which	gives	it	heat	and	backbone.

Ginger	is	great	on	its	own,	but	also	works	great	with	other	flavors.	It’s	one	of	those	“wake	up”	flavors
that	you	can	hide	beneath	all	sorts	of	other	flavors.	I	think	it	works	especially	well	with	citrus.	It	works
with	yuzu,	passion	fruit,	coconut,	banana,	and	other	tropical	flavors.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

My	mom	always	had	candied	ginger	in	the	spice	cupboard	when	I	was	growing	up.	Today	at	the
restaurant,	we	take	candied	ginger	and	combine	it	with	whatever	fruit	is	in	season	—	from	nectarines,	to
cherries,	to	quince	—	and	then	add	Vin	Santo	to	make	a	sauce	for	our	foie	gras.	Vin	Santo	brings	nuttiness


and	candied	ginger	brings	spice	that	both	cut	through	the	fat	of	the	foie	gras.	I	think	nectarines	and	candied
ginger	are	a	perfect	flavor	combination.

fun	to	play	with.	I	like	mint	in	the	dish	because	it	refreshes	and	wakes	your	palate	up.	When	you	get	a

Halibut	from	the	East	Coast	is	the	most	delicate	and	silky	fish.	It	is	different	than	Alaskan	halibut,	which
is	drier,	meatier,	and	more	robust.	East	Coast	halibut	is	so	delicate	that	anything	can	kill	it.	That	is	why
we	steam	and	poach	so	much	here:	Even	searing	it	too	strongly	in	the	pan	will	hurt	a	piece	of	halibut.

We’ll	poach	halibut,	then	serve	it	with	a	blood	orange	vinaigrette	made	with	extra-virgin	olive	oil,
which	gives	it	a	round	and	full	flavor.	The	fish	is	then	served	atop	a	carpaccio	of	golden	beets	that	have
been	cooked	in	sherry	vinegar.	The	beets	have	a	sweet-and-sour	flavor	to	them.	They	are	also	very
crunchy,	which	I	like	with	the	creamy	texture	of	the	halibut.	The	vinaigrette	brings	the	right	degree	of
acidity	to	the	dish	to	make	it	exciting.
—	ERIC	RIPERT,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Halibut	is	a	gentle-tasting	fish,	which	leads	to	gentle	herbs	like	cilantro,	chives,	or	chervil.

HERBS	(See	specific	herbs)

Herbs	101	with	Jerry	Traunfeld	of	The	Herbfarm,
Woodinville,	Washington
Working	with	herbs	is	very	different	from	working	with	spices.	With	herbs,	you	can	really
only	work	with	a	few	at	a	time.	With	spices,	you	can	throw	so	many	more	together.	An
Indian	dish	may	have	more	than	a	dozen	spices	in	it.	Here	are	some	guidelines:

•	Know	your	herb.	Herbs	range	in	intensity,	so	you	need	to	know	the	profile	of	the	herb	you	are	choosing
at	the	start.	You	need	to	be	careful;	for	example,	if	you	add	rosemary	to	chervil	it	will	overpower	the
chervil.
•	You	want	to	pair	delicate	with	delicate	or	strong	with	strong.	Chervil	is	possibly	the	most	delicate
herb.	Lemon	basil	and	lemon	thyme	would	be	in	the	middle.	Lemon	verbena	or	tarragon	I	would	consider
loud.	Then	you	have	bay	leaf	which	is	light,	until	you	add	twenty	together	and	it	becomes	strong.
•	Not	all	herbs	are	created	equal,	and	they	can	vary	within	their	categories	or	season.	Oregano	can	be


mild,	or	hot	and	spicy.	With	mint,	applemint	is	mild	while	peppermint	is	strong.	The	season	also	has	an
effect	on	rosemary:	in	the	winter,	rosemary	is	mild	and	in	the	summer,	it	is	strong.
•	Herbs	have	regional	affinities.	Mediterranean	herbs	marry	well	together.	Rosemary	and	marjoram	or
thyme	and	savory	are	naturals	together.	Among	Asian	herbs,	lemongrass	goes	with	mint	and	cilantro	or
mint	and	chives.	In	France,	you	have	lots	of	combinations:	chervil,	tarragon,	chives,	and	parsley.	The	one
exception	to	France’s	herbs	is	tarragon,	which	is	probably	best	on	its	own.
•	Herbs	also	have	seasonal	affinities.	Summer	vegetables	work	with	summer	herbs,	as	do	winter
vegetables	with	winter	herbs.	In	summer,	it	is	basil	or	marjoram	with	tomatoes.	Basil	with	zucchini	is	one
of	my	favorite	combinations.	In	winter,	sage	and	rosemary	work	with	potatoes	and	root	vegetables.	Also
in	winter,	one	of	my	favorite	combinations	is	butternut	squash	with	bay	leaf	and	nutmeg.	Pumpkin	and	bay
leaf	together	make	the	pumpkin	taste	even	more	pumpkin-like.
•	How	to	use	the	chosen	herb.	Soft-leaved	herbs	—	such	as	basil,	chervil,	chives,	cilantro,	dill,	lovage,
and	sorrel	—	shouldn’t	be	cooked	because	they	will	lose	their	flavor.	Tough-leaved	herbs	—	such	as	bay
leaf,	savory,	and	rosemary	—	can	go	into	dishes	and	stand	up	to	heat	and	cooking.
•	Choose	an	herb	that	is	the	same	intensity	as	your	protein.	Halibut	is	a	gentle-tasting	fish,	which	leads
to	gentle	herbs	like	cilantro,	chives,	or	chervil.	Smelt	is	a	local	fish	that	is	oily,	so	here	we	look	to
stronger	herbs	like	oregano,	savory,	or	rosemary.
•	Herbs	aren’t	exclusive	to	savory	dishes.	Anise	hyssop	works	with	most	stone	fruits	like	peaches.
Cinnamon	basil	works	with	blue	huckleberries.	Cinnamon	with	blueberries	really	intensifies	the	flavor	of
the	blueberry.	Lavender	works	with	plums	or	peaches.	Lemony	herbs	like	basil	or	anise	hyssop	work	with
watermelon.	Rosemary	works	with	apples	or	pears.	Sage	works	with	tart	cherries.	Tarragon	works	with
muskmelon.

We	grow	forty	different	tomatoes	and	eight	different	basils.	Our	farmer	planted	the	tomatoes	surrounded
by	the	basil,	and	I	thought	he	did	it	because	they	taste	good	together.	It	turns	out	that	doing	so	attracts
beneficial	insects	to	each.	Our	farmer	believes	that	tomato	and	basil	work	so	well	on	the	plate	because
they	work	so	well	in	the	field.	He	also	explained	that	if	you	plant	certain	basils	next	to	tomatoes,	you	can
taste	it	in	the	tomato.

All	our	cooks	take	care	of	their	own	section	of	the	herb	garden.	The	garde-manger	cooks	[who
prepare	appetizers]	look	after	the	chives	and	chervil.	The	fish	cooks	care	for	the	lemon	herbs	like	lemon
thyme	and	lemongrass,	and	the	meat	cooks	for	the	rosemary,	sage,	and	thyme.	Our	pastry	cooks	tend	the
edible	flowers	that	can	be	candied,	and	mint	and	lemon	verbena,	which	they	use	in	sorbets.
—	DAN	BARBER,	BLUE	HILL	AT	STONE	BARNS	(POCANTICO	HILLS,	NEW	YORK)

I	am	a	big	fan	of	roasting	and	resting	meat	on	herbs.	If	you	roast	a	rib	eye,	prime	rib,	or	filet	mignon,	most
people	would	put	it	on	a	sheet	tray	with	a	roasting	rack.	One	day,	I	didn’t	have	a	roasting	rack	but	I	had	a
lot	of	thyme	and	savory	and	rosemary,	so	I	threw	the	meat	on	top	and	roasted	it.	The	technique	did	the
trick	by	keeping	the	meat	from	the	juices	and	it	also	enhanced	the	flavor	that	much	more.	Since	then,	we
have	stopped	using	roasting	racks	for	our	meats	and	switched	to	herbs.	During	the	roasting	process,	I	like
to	turn	the	meat	so	that	the	flavor	of	the	herbs	penetrates	even	more.	Since	you	are	roasting	in	a	closed
oven,	the	air	circulates	the	herb	flavor.

For	a	lamb	shoulder,	if	you	can’t	get	hay,	I	would	recommend	using	savory,	thyme,	sage,	and
rosemary.	This	technique	is	great	for	a	whole	chicken:	slice	some	truffles	to	put	under	the	chicken	skin,
brush	it	with	butter,	and	put	it	on	a	bed	of	savory	and	thyme.	It	will	be	pretty	incredible.

—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	use	honey	as	a	flavor,	not	as	a	sweetener	like	sugar.	In	my	honey	panna	cotta,	I	add	some	sugar	to	make
it	sweet	enough.	If	I	used	only	honey	as	a	sweetener,	the	flavor	of	honey	would	be	too	strong	and	the

Heating	grated	horseradish	changes	the	horseradish	completely.	It	makes	it	more	mellow	and	takes	away
the	bite	while	keeping	its	yummy	flavor.	Horseradish	prepared	this	way	works	well	with	Nantucket	Bay
scallops	that	are	naturally	sweet	and	work	with	the	sweetness	of	the	horseradish.	We	will	also	use	it	in	a
lemony	vinaigrette	and	dress	a	smoked	trout	with	it.

First,	grate	horseradish	on	a	microplane	[a	fine	grater].	Coat	a	ten-inch	skillet	with	some	Ligurian
olive	oil,	and	heat	the	horseradish	over	medium	heat.	Watch	it	very	closely,	because	the	minute	it	starts	to
turn	from	its	blond	color,	it	is	done.	From	there,	transfer	it	into	cold	pans	to	cool	it	quickly.	When	it	is
totally	cool	and	has	its	crunch,	add	some	lemon	zest	and	kosher	salt.

In	Eastern	European	or	Hungarian	cooking,	you	will	see	a	stewed	or	braised	dish	flavored	with	paprika
that	is	cut	with	sour	cream	either	in	it	or	served	on	top	so	that	it	mixes	together	as	you	eat	it.	I	serve	rare
roasted	venison	in	venison	stock	with	hot	and	sweet	paprika	that	is	essentially	a	goulash.	Alongside,	I
serve	creamed	sauerkraut	that	bleeds	into	the	sauce	and	gives	the	same	effect	as	a	goulash.	Even	though
the	sauerkraut	has	an	intense	flavor,	it	is	still	mild	because	it	has	been	cooked	in	cream.	It	is	not	a
Hungarian	dish	but	rather	a	play	on	a	Hungarian	dish,	and	it	works	in	the	context	of	the	subtler	intensity	of
flavors	I	like.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

—	MEERU	DHALWALA,	VIJ’S	(VANCOUVER)


If	my	mind	is	in	India,	tamarind	will	be	sneaking	its	way	into	the	dish.	When	thinking	of	India,	my
inspirations	are	the	flavors	of	clove,	cardamom,	and	coriander	seed.	They	are	aromatic	spices	that	really
cut	the	fat	of	the	dish,	so	it	is	not	big,	fat,	and	flabby	on	the	palate.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	worked	in	an	Indian	restaurant	as	a	waiter	for	four	years.	I	love	cooking	with	Indian	ingredients.
Everything	I	learned	at	the	CIA	was	thrown	out	the	window	when	I	learned	Indian	cooking,	which	is
where	I	picked	up	many	techniques	and	philosophies.	I	now	roast	my	own	spices	and	create	spice	blends.
I	love	creating	my	own	flavor	combinations.	I	came	to	love	a	garam	masala	made	with	fennel,	cinnamon,
clove,	cumin,	and	coriander.	Each	of	these	five	spices	has	a	distinctive	flavor,	but	combined	they	create
one	single	flavor	that	is	amazing.	I	will	use	my	garam	masala	mixture	in	soups	and	sauces.	When	people
ask	about	the	dish,	they	always	ask,	“What	was	that	flavor?”

—	MARIO	BATALI,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Holly	Smith	of	Café	Juanita	in	Seattle	on	Five	Flavors	that
Will	Take	You	to	Northern	Italy
White	Truffles.	The	perfect	vehicle	for	white	truffles	is	hand-cut	pasta	that	is	egg	rich.
Eggs	that	taste	like	real	eggs	make	a	great	pasta.	Our	pasta	is	egg	rich	and	has	35	egg
yolks	to	a	kilo	(2.2	pounds)	of	flour.	You	can	get	them	in	there,	it	is	crazy!	The	pasta	looks
like	a	sunset.	On	the	pasta,	I	would	first	put	butter	barely	scented	with	sage,	before
shaving	the	truffles	on	top.

Nebbiolo.	Beef	cheeks	braised	in	Nebbiolo	[wine].	To	keep	it	simple,	we	serve	roasted
turnips	and	the	reduced	sauce	with	pomegranate	seeds	and	that’s	it.	We	braise	our	cheeks
for	seven	and	a	half	hours.	Most	braised	dishes	go	four	hours,	but	not	beef	cheeks	—
anything	less,	and	they	are	[still	tough].

Anchovies.	I	love	a	really	acidic	anchovy	vinaigrette	for	a	bread	salad.	Anchovies	with

roasted	garlic	are	like	butter	at	this	restaurant;	they	go	in	lots	of	dishes.	We	put	them	in
lamb,	we	put	them	in	between	potatoes	with	chicken	stock	for	a	gratin.	We	love	them.	I	like
anchovies	with	sage	on	each	side	deep	fried	for	an	appetizer.	We	cook	anchovies	in	olive
oil	with	a	little	butter	until	they	get	toasty,	throw	in	onions	to	caramelize,	and	serve	this	with


fish.

Hazelnuts.	Chocolate	and	hazelnut	is	the	perfect	combination	so	we	make	gianduja
and	put	it	inside	crepes	and	warm	them	and	put	chestnut	honey	on	top.	Most	of	the	time
hazelnuts	end	up	in	salad	or	ground	for	a	final	dusting	for	a	pasta.	Beet	pasta	that	looks	like
candy	wrappers	is	served	on	top	of	a	warm	plate	that	has	just	been	smeared	with
Gorgonzola	Piccante,	then	topped	with	ground	hazelnuts	just	before	it	is	served.	Blue
cheese	and	hazelnuts	is	it	for	me.

Goat	Meat.	I	just	had	spit-roasted	goat	at	Da	Cesare.	If	I	knew	I	was	going	to	die,	I
would	get	myself	there	[to	the	Piedmont	region	of	Italy].	Roasted	goat	basted	with	garlic,
olive	oil,	marjoram,	mint,	or	rosemary	is	it.

Kohlrabi	is	an	underrated	vegetable.	I	admit	it	has	not	always	been	one	of	my	favorites,	but	it	has	grown
on	me	over	the	years.	Now,	I	love	it.	I	can’t	precisely	place	its	flavor,	which	is	somewhere	between	a
turnip,	radish,	and	cauliflower.	But	it	tastes	great	and	is	really	versatile.	You	can	grill	it,	roast	it,	glaze	it
like	a	carrot,	or	make	a	gratin	out	of	it	with	potatoes.	We	have	even	grated	it	and	made	a	rémoulade	ouof
it	like	you	would	with	a	celery	root.	But	the	best	way	to	enjoy	kohlrabi	is	grilled,	roasted,	and	drizzled

LAMB	—	IN	GENERAL

Season:	spring
Taste:	sweet,	astringent
Function:	heating
Weight:	heavy
Volume:	moderate–loud
Techniques:	braise	(esp.	shanks),	grill	(esp.	leg),	roast	(esp.	leg),	stew	(esp.	shoulder)
Tips:	Cloves	add	richness	to	the	flavor	of	lamb.

Our	signature	wine-marinated	lamb	popsicles	in	fenugreek	cream	curry	on	spinach	potatoes	dish	is	bare
rugged	simplicity.	You	have	rack	of	lamb	that	has	been	cooked	just	a	few	minutes.	Then	you	have	a	simple
sauce	that	is	essentially	just	cream	and	garlic	—	and	you	can	taste	all	three.	We	add	some	green	fenugreek
that	gives	an	earthiness	to	the	dish	and	takes	it	to	a	whole	new	level.	It	is	incredibly	simple.	It	is	a	dish
about	technique	because	if	the	garlic	is	cooked	too	long,	it	gets	bitter.	Or	if	you	add	too	much	fenugreek,	it
gets	bitter	and	overpowers	the	cream.	But	in	the	right	proportions,	it	is	perfect.

a	spit	and	every	Friday	night	we	roast	a	whole	lamb.	I	am	a	big	fan	of	lamb	shoulder.	It	can	take	a	beating
and	in	the	end	come	out	glorious	tasting!	There	is	an	old	French	technique	where	they	cook	ham	in	hay.
The	hay	is	submerged	in	water;	then	they	put	the	ham	on	it	to	cook.	It	is	amazing.	We	adapted	this
technique	to	the	lamb.	We	had	our	farmer	collect	the	hay	and	grass	in	the	field	where	the	lamb	grazed	with
the	thinking	that	this	is	what	the	lamb	actually	ate.	We	then	dry	the	hay	by	letting	it	sit	out	overnight	on	a
tray,	so	it	becomes	really	butterscotchy	and	barnyardy.	You	can	use	any	hay	for	this	technique	but	I’m	just
a	purist.

We	brine	a	boneless	shoulder	of	lamb	for	24	hours	in	a	brining	solution	of	1	cup	of	salt	and	1⁄cup	of


sugar	in	a	gallon	of	water,	[adding]	some	peppercorns,	bay	leaf,	a	couple	of	cardamom	pods,	a	cinnamon
stick,	and	cumin.	The	brine	is	brought	to	a	boil,	cooled	down,	and	the	lamb	goes	in.	After	the	brining	we
rub	the	lamb	with	garlic	and	summer	savory	and	tie	it	up	into	a	log	and	put	it	on	the	bed	of	hay,	drizzle	it
with	white	wine,	cover	it,	and	put	it	in	the	oven.	It	is	nature	going	back	on	itself.	The	lamb	ate	the	hay,	the
hay	makes	the	lamb	taste	better.	When	it’s	cooked,	the	flavors	are	intense	but	pleasant	and	it	becomes
something	else.	When	lavender	is	in	season,	I’ll	throw	some	in	the	hay	as	well	and	it	is	delicious.

With	the	lamb	I	like	to	serve	a	stuffed	tomato	Provençal	[typically	a	combination	of	basil,	bread
crumbs,	garlic,	olive	oil].	You	want	to	serve	something	simple.	You	could	also	serve	a	crushed	potato
with	savory	and	olive	oil	or	a	medley	of	vegetables.

LEMONS

Season:	year-round
Taste:	sour
Weight:	light
Volume:	loud
almonds

We	have	lemon	juice	right	next	to	the	salt	when	we	cook.	Acid	is	the	most	important	aspect	of	how	a	dish
tastes	—	whether	it	is	there	as	subtle	punctuation	or	an	exclamation	point!
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

Lemon	zest	adds	a	totally	different	dynamic	than	lemon	juice.	If	you	are	making	an	apple	crisp,	if	you
added	a	teaspoon	of	zest	it	would	taste	very	different	than	if	you	added	lemon	juice.	The	juice	would
make	it	taste	tart,	whereas	the	zest	would	actually	add	a	lemon	flavor	component	to	it.	For	ice	cream,
custards,	and	tarts,	use	lemon	juice.	But	if	you	are	going	to	combine	lemon	with	other	flavors,	that’s	when
you	use	zest.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Use	lemon	juice	when	you	want	the	acid	and	lemony	flavor	of	the	juice.	If	you	want	the	perfume	of	the
lemon,	use	the	zest	because	the	skin	is	where	you	get	the	essential	oils.	I	use	more	lemon	and	orange	than
vanilla	in	my	cooking	because	they	are	more	prevalent	in	Italy	and	in	Italian	cooking,	and	a	flavor	profile
that	people	recognize	as	Italian.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Lemon	can	be	used	by	itself	or	with	other	ingredients	because	it	enhances	so	many	flavors.	An	orange	can
be	a	little	too	mellow,	but	lemon	makes	flavors	much	brighter.	Lemon	is	an	underlying	flavor	as	much	as
the	star.	If	there	is	one	fruit	you	had	to	always	have	on	hand	as	a	basic	staple,	it	is	lemon.

We	churn	through	preserved	lemons!	In	the	middle	of	the	summer,	we	buy	cases	so	that	we	can	age	them
eight	months	before	we	use	them.	After	six	months,	they	are	great.	After	eight	months	or	a	year,	you	see
God.	They	become	incredible	just	by	waiting	those	extra	few	months.	I	make	preserved	lemons	by	feel.	I
primarily	use	salt	and	will	add	some	cinnamon,	clove,	nigella,	a	tiny,	tiny	bit	of	saffron,	and	then	just	tuck
them	away	in	the	refrigerator.	If	I	wasn’t	so	greedy,	I	would	give	them	away,	but	we	are	talking	a	year	of
my	life	here!
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	you	are	using	different	kinds	of	lemons,	you	need	to	treat	them	as	different	things.	A	Meyer	lemon
is	different	from	a	regular	lemon.	If	you	are	using	a	Meyer	lemon,	you	may	want	the	perfume,	aroma,	and
subtlety	of	it.	Yet	when	you	taste	it,	you	may	want	to	add	a	touch	of	regular	lemon	to	give	it	a	little	more
acidity	and	a	little	kick.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

We	get	a	lot	of	Meyer	lemons	in	during	the	season,	and	they	have	a	lovely	sweet-orangey	lemon	flavor.
But	there	are	times	that	they	are	simply	too	sweet	and	we	have	to	either	add	regular	lemon	or	some	lime
to	balance	the	Meyer	lemon.

Bibb	lettuce	is	a	light,	delicate,	and	almost	creamy	lettuce,	so	I	serve	it	with	a	creamy	dressing	to	mimic
that	creaminess.	Because	of	its	delicacy,	to	make	the	mayonnaise	I’ll	use	a	neutral	oil	that’s	a	blend	of	80
percent	canola	and	20	percent	olive.	It	finds	a	counterpoint	in	lemon	and	fines	herbes,	and	gets	a	note	of
freshness,	crunch,	and	spicy	heat	from	radishes.

I	love	lobster:	poached,	roasted,	or	grilled.	I	like	mayonnaise	or	a	vinaigrette	with	my	lobster	much	more
than	butter	with	lobster.	In	the	summertime,	I	like	it	with	small	potatoes	and	corn.	I	really	like	it	with
cilantro.

For	my	dish	Roasted	Maine	Lobster	in	“Folly	of	Herbs”	with	Baby	Fennel	and	Salsify,	I	wanted	to	do
something	different	with	lobster	besides	a	lobster	sauce.	I	make	a	“tea”	of	dried	herbs:	thyme,	rosemary,
fennel	seeds,	oregano,	sage,	mint,	and	tarragon.	This	is	boiled	and	strained,	then	gets	a	dash	of	Ricard
[also	known	as	Pernod,	an	anise-flavored	liquor].	The	lobster	gets	finished	with	fresh	parsley,	mint,	and
fresh	oregano.	I	chose	these	two	vegetables	because	salsify	is	underused	and	underappreciated.	I	don’t
blanch	my	salsify	in	water	because	when	you	do,	the	flavor	stays	in	the	water.	I	roast	them	and	caramelize
them	a	little	bit,	then	deglaze	with	just	a	little	water	with	a	sprig	of	thyme	and	a	bay	leaf.	Baby	fennel	is
good	because	it	plays	off	the	Ricard	and	fennel.	I	quickly	blanch	the	fennel	and	then	caramelize	it.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Cooked	lobster	meat	blends	well	with	mayonnaise,	but	I	don’t	think	I’d	use	it	with	raw	lobster	—	I’d	use
soy	sauce	instead.

—	LISSA	DOUMANI,	TERRA	(ST.	HELENA,	CALIFORNIA)

Macadamia	nuts	are	buttery,	rich	nuts.	I	will	even	pair	them	with	sea	scallops,	which	also	have	a
richness	to	them.	The	macadamia	nuts	don’t	overwhelm	the	scallops	and	I	put	them	in	the	dish	slightly
chopped	—	otherwise,	the	texture	of	the	nut	would	be	too	chewy.	We	use	macadamia	nuts	on	one	of	the
simplest	yet	most	popular	dishes	on	our	menu	—	our	jumbo	lump	crab	cake	with	grilled	asparagus	and

I	typically	use	maple	syrup	with	nuts,	like	in	a	pecan	pie.	I	will	replace	the	dark	corn	syrup	in	the	recipe
with	maple	syrup	instead.	It	is	always	important	to	use	a	very	good	quality	[e.g.,	Vermont	or	Canadian]
maple	syrup.	If	you	are	working	with	syrup	and	sugar,	you	need	to	be	careful	because	the	combination	of

MENU

Tips:	Strive	for	balance	over	an	entire	menu,	i.e.,	appetizer,	entrée,	and	dessert.	Envision	the


course	of	a	menu	as	a	piece	of	music	having	a	melody,	rhythm,	and	tempo.

When	planning	a	menu,	pick	the	dessert	or	the	entrée	first	and	have	the	other	one	match	it,	in	terms	of
style	and	preparation.	If	you	are	doing	an	entrée	that	requires	last-minute	time	in	the	kitchen,	don’t	serve	a
dessert	that	requires	last-minute	time	as	well.	If	you	have	a	main	course	that	takes	last-minute	work,	serve
a	dessert	that	can	be	made	a	day	ahead	—	or	if	your	dessert	is	what	needs	last-minute	attention,	serve	it
after	a	stew	or	lasagna.	When	deciding	what	to	make,	remember:	The	heavier	the	main	course,	the	lighter
the	dessert	should	be,	or	vice	versa.	I	was	recently	going	through	some	of	my	earlier	books	and	was
shocked	when	I	looked	at	the	recipes.	One	recipe	for	a	chocolate	cake	that	we	served	at	Stars	was	served
in	big	wedges.	I	was	amazed	we	used	to	serve	such	a	huge	portion!	People	can’t	eat	like	that	anymore.	At
the	same	time,	the	cake	is	so	good	I	still	want	to	serve	it	so	I	work	backward.	I	will	serve	a	chicken	or
something	else	light	for	the	main	course,	not	a	prime	rib	of	beef.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Creating	new	dishes	has	to	be	more	than	simply	intensifying	flavors	for	dishes.	In	terms	of	visual
presentation,	we	are	shifting	into	a	new	direction	where	the	food	looks	like	one	thing,	but	is	really
something	else.	That	adds	an	extra	element	of	challenge	for	us.	An	example	of	this	would	be	a	[Mexican-
inspired]	nacho	dish	we	just	created.	You	get	something	that	looks	like	chips,	sour	cream,	salsa	verde,
and	grated	cheese.	The	cheese	is	actually	grated	from	saffron	ice	cream	that	we	have	thrown	into	liquid
nitrogen,	that	is	put	into	a	food	processor	grater.	The	salsa	verde	is	made	from	kiwi,	mint	puree,	and
epozote	to	give	it	a	little	twist.	The	sour	cream	is	a	yuzu	crème	fraîche.	The	chips	are	made	from	pureed
corn	tortilla	chips	that	have	been	sweetened	with	powdered	sugar,	then	pasted	into	triangles	and	deep
fried.	So	you	get	something	that	looks	like	nachos,	but	tastes	completely	different.	So	we	are	taking	a
visual	aspect	of	something	you	are	comfortable	with	and	serving	it	at	the	end	of	a	twenty-course	meal.

—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

I	was	actually	brought	up	in	the	school	of	thought	that	put	a	sprig	of	mint	on	every	dessert.	I	am	nothat
guy	anymore.	I	have	a	saying	—	“NFG”	—	which	stands	for	two	things	at	once:	“nonfunctional	garnishes”
are	“no	fucking	good.”	If	something	doesn’t	make	sense	to	the	dish,	it	won’t	be	there.	I	hate	ordering	lamb
and	seeing	a	huge	bunch	of	rosemary	alongside	it.	Put	it	in	the	dish	—	let	me	taste	it!
—	JOHNNY	IUZZINI,	JEAN	GEORGES	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	mint	flavor,	but	some	cooks	started	throwing	mint	on	desserts	just	because	they	liked	the	color	of	it.
If	you	have	a	gorgeous	strawberry	shortcake	and	add	some	mint	to	it,	one	of	two	things	will	happen:	1)
Either	you	don’t	eat	it,	so	what’s	the	point	of	putting	it	on	the	plate	in	the	first	place,	or	2)	If	you	doeat	it,
that	one	mint	leaf	will	completely	change	the	balance	of	the	dessert.	If	you	have	a	lemon	tart	that	is	mostly
perfectly	balanced	lemon	curd	with	a	little	whipped	cream	and	you	add	a	mint	leaf	to	the	dessert,	the	leaf
will	play	havoc	with	that	balance.	So	don’t	throw	mint	on	a	plate	haphazardly,	or	you’ll	throw	off	the
balance	of	the	entire	dessert.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

The	first	place	I	think	of	with	mint	is	Morocco.	From	there,	it	is	the	Middle	East.	Mint	and	lamb	is	such	a
natural	combination,	as	is	mint	and	yogurt.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	don’t	use	mint	very	much,	but	I	have	a	serious	thing	for	black	peppermint!	You	will	see	it	in	one	form	or
another	on	my	menu.	I	go	to	the	farmers’	market	twice	a	week	and	use	it	all	summer.	It	is	great	with
berries.	It	works	best	with	something	light	like	an	infusion	or	granita.	Last	summer,	we	made	a	tangy
lychee	gelée	that	was	served	under	oven-roasted	Tristar	strawberries	tossed	lightly	with	balsamic
vinegar.	On	top	of	the	strawberries,	we	scooped	the	black	peppermint	sorbet.

I	like	to	add	miso	to	purees	because	it	adds	a	rich,	buttery	flavor	and	a	rich	texture.	I	will	serve	broiled
oysters	topped	with	a	puree	of	miso,	pineapple,	and	serrano	chile.	I	am	working	on	miso-avocado	puree
as	well.	It	is	delicious,	but	I	just	haven’t	found	the	right	dish	for	it	yet.	I	am	also	working	with	miso-
huitlacoche	soup	with	tofu,	mushrooms,	or	corn.
—	KATSUYA	FUKUSHIMA,	MINIBAR	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	love	miso.	I	went	to	a	Japanese	restaurant	and	loved	the	miso	soup.	I	realized	that	it	would	give	more
flavor	than	chicken	broth	to	my	onion	soup.	So	now	I	make	a	miso	broth	the	night	before,	let	it	sit	and
separate,	and	use	the	broth	for	my	onion	soup.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	will	use	several	different	misos,	depending	on	the	purpose.	I	might	use	saikyo,	a	light,	yellow,	sweet
miso,	in	marinades	or	with	lighter	fish	like	sweet	shrimp	and	scallops	that	would	be	overwhelmed	by


dark	miso.	Barley	miso	is	a	distinctive	strong,	sweet	miso	that	I’ll	use	with	nigiri	with	baby	squid	and
shiso.	I’ll	use	wheat	miso	with	foie	gras.	Sometimes	I’ll	even	mix	misos.

Vitaly	Paley	of	Paley’s	Place	in	Portland,	Oregon,	on	Cooking
with	Mushrooms

Mushrooms	Year-Round
Spring.	This	is	the	start	of	the	morel	season.	One	of	the	reasons	I	came	to	work	in	Oregon
was	one	day	I	was	working	in	a	kitchen	in	France	and	a	box	of	morels	arrived	with	a	tag	on
it	that	said	“Oregon.”

Summer.	The	morels	dwindle	away,	and	we	get	a	brief	stint	of	porcini/cepes.	Late

summer	is	golden	and	white	chanterelle	season.

Fall.	The	porcini	come	back	and	we	also	get	in	matsutake	mushrooms	as	well.	We	have

[Pacific	Northwest]	black	and	white	truffles	here	and	the	season	starts	in	November.	They
are	pretty	flavorful	but	it	is	important	to	realize	they	are	different	from	European	truffles	—
not	to	mention	a	lot	less	expensive.

I’m	not	a	big	fan	of	cultivated	mushrooms	but	I	do	like	a	few.	King	oyster	or	trumpet
royal	are	the	same	mushroom	and	it	is	one	of	my	favorites.	Portobellos	are	also	good,
though	they	are	a	little	‘70s.

I	am	suspicious	of	some	dried	mushrooms	you	find	in	the	supermarket	only	because

you	don’t	know	how	old	they	are	and	how	much	flavor	they	will	have.

Buying	and	Cleaning	Mushrooms
When	it	comes	to	mushrooms,	every	kind	needs	to	be	well	cleaned	because	there	is
nothing	worse	than	getting	a	mouthful	of	grit.	I	wash	them	all	by	soaking	them	in	a	bowl	of
water	and	pulling	them	out.	The	key	to	remember	is	that	you	want	to	use	mushrooms	soon
after	washing	them.	Don’t	wash	them	a	day	ahead.

For	morel	mushrooms,	you	need	to	know	how	to	cook	them,	and	slicing	them	up	fresh

and	throwing	them	in	a	pan	is	not	it.	It	is	very	important	to	clean	them	and	I	recommend
blanching	them.	Fill	a	pot	with	cold	water,	toss	in	a	handful	of	salt	and	then	the	mushrooms.
Bring	the	pot	to	a	boil,	scoop	out	the	mushrooms,	spread	them	out,	and	lightly	squeeze
them	dry.	As	you	dry	them,	take	a	good	look	at	them	to	make	sure	they	are	free	of	twigs
and	such.

Seasoning	Mushrooms
When	it	comes	to	seasoning	mushrooms,	savory	works	across	the	board.	The	seasoning
combination	that	I’ve	used	in	my	kitchen	from	day	one	is	a	raw	parsley	and	garlic
combination	that	in	French	is	called	persillade.	After	the	mushrooms	have	been	sautéed	in
butter	or	olive	oil,	at	the	last	second	you	toss	in	this	combination	with	a	pinch	of	salt.	That	is
all	a	mushroom	needs	most	of	the	time!

If	you	are	roasting	porcini	or	king	oyster	mushrooms,	roast	them	on	a	bed	of	savory	or

thyme	for	extra	flavor.

Good	cooking	transcends	all	cultures.	You	can	take	inspiration	from	all	around	the	world	and	apply	it	to
what	you	are	cooking	without	making	it	“fusion.”	In	some	cases,	you	can	even	take	a	classic	and	make	it
taste	better.	I	worked	with	Floyd	Cardoz	[chef	of	the	Indian	restaurant	Tabla	in	New	York	City]	and
learned	a	lot	about	Indian	spicing	and	technique	from	him.	One	technique	was	turka,	which	is	where	you
fry	spices	in	oil	or	ghee	[Indian	clarified	butter]	until	they	pop.	It	really	opens	up	the	flavor	of	the	spices.
I	use	this	cross-cultural	technique	when	making	a	veal	dish	with	a	great	mustard	sauce,	which	is	a
classic	French	dish,	and	the	result	is	not	a	fusion	dish:	Take	black,	yellow,	and	red	mustard	seeds	and
toast	them	in	butter	or	olive	oil	until	they	pop;	then	add	some	shallots	and	vermouth	and	reduce	it.	Then,
add	veal	stock	with	a	splash	of	cream	and	Dijon	mustard.	The	result	is	a	very	complex	sauce	with	a	much
deeper	flavor,	versus	simply	combining	some	cream	and	mustard	together	in	the	pan.

NUTS	—	IN	GENERAL	(See	also	Pecans,	Walnuts,	etc.)

Weight:	heavy
Volume:	moderate	(varies	by	nut)
Tips:	Always	toast	nuts	before	using	to	enhance	flavor	and	texture.

I	love	nuts,	and	put	them	in	everything.	I	find	that	almost	all	nuts	pair	well	with	a	lot	of	different	things.
When	I	am	creating	a	dessert,	I	will	choose	my	nuts	geographically.	For	example,	if	I	am	making	a
Sicilian	dessert,	I’ll	use	pistachios	because	that	is	the	nut	they	would	use	[in	Sicily].
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Marcel	Desaulniers	of	The	Trellis	in	Williamsburg,	Virginia,
on	Nuts
We	use	a	great	deal	of	nuts	at	the	restaurant.	On	our	fall	menu,	we	have	nuts	in	six	out	of
ten	entrées.	Using	nuts	has	always	been	one	of	my	hallmarks	in	terms	of	adding	texture
to	everything	from	a	salad	or	soup	to	entrées	and	desserts.	This	philosophy	hasn’t
changed	much	since	1987	when	I	opened.	I	can’t	think	of	a	nut	that	doesn’t,	in	essence,
work	in	both	sweet	and	savory	dishes.

Chunk	Light	Tuna	with	Seedless	Grapes,	Chopped	Walnuts,	and	Mayonnaise	on	Toasted
Whole	Wheat	Bread	Garnished	with	Watercress,	Grapes,	and	Walnuts

The	quality	of	chopped	nuts	can	never	compare	with	the	quality	of	whole	nuts.	In	26	years,	we	have	never
bought	chopped	pecans	because	the	quality	is	so	different,	despite	the	fact	that	it	would	be	a	lot	less
expensive.

I	recommend	simply	chopping	by	hand	or,	in	the	case	of	something	like	a	pecan,	breaking	it	with	your
fingers.	Pecans	have	so	much	moisture	that	if	you	chop	them,	you	lose	what	is	special	about	their	texture.
People	tend	to	put	nuts	into	the	food	processor	and	the	next	thing	you	know,	you	have	powder	and	not
pieces.

We	always	toast	our	nuts,	100	percent	of	the	time.	Nuts	absorb	a	lot	of	moisture,	so	by	toasting	them
you	dry	them	out	and	heighten	the	flavor.	You	do	need	to	be	careful,	because	they	burn	so	easily.	Slower
roasting	is	better.	With	a	nut	like	a	cashew,	you	want	to	roast	them	at	325	degrees	to	get	them	to	be	a	nice,
golden	brown.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

Always	toast	nuts	to	bring	up	the	flavor.	If	you	don’t	toast	the	nuts	before	adding	them	to	a	dish,	they	tend
to	come	out	soggy	when	the	dish	is	done.	The	one	exception	would	be	if	they	are	going	on	top	of	a	tart
going	into	the	oven,	because	then	they	would	be	overtoasted.

Nuts	work	great	in	adding	texture,	especially	to	creamy	and/or	moussey	desserts.	The	other	way	to

balance	out	richness	is	with	some	phyllo	dough.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Juicing	nuts	is	the	new	thing	we	are	doing.	We’ll	juice	almonds,	hazelnuts,	and	—	best	of	all	—	pine	nuts,
which	comes	out	like	pine	nut	butter.	Juicing	pine	nuts	is	better	than	grinding	them,	because	it	pulverizes
their	fat.	We	put	that	on	some	local	green	beans	with	preserved	lemon	zest,	to	serve	with	spring	onions
with	lamb.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)


Lavender	works	well	with	all	sorts	of	nuts,	including	almonds,	hazelnuts,	pistachios,	and	walnuts.	The
one	nut	it	doesn’t	work	well	with	is	chestnuts.

to	New	Zealand	snapper	to	John	Dory	—	in	avocado	oil.	It	gives	an	incredible	texture	and	depth	of
flavor.	I	also	like	it	with	vegetarian	dishes.	I	use	it	in	dressings,	and	it	seems	to	hold	an	emulsion	really
well.	It	has	a	nice	affinity	with	tomato;	I	have	made	tomato	water	with	chardonnay	vinegar	and	avocado
oil,	and	it	makes	beautiful	light	dressing.	It	also	goes	well	with	citrus	like	lemon,	lime,	or	orange.	Just
like	you	like	to	squeeze	some	citrus	over	avocado,	avocado	oil	works	the	same	way	in	reverse.

Vinaigrette
—	Monica	Pope,	T’afia	(Houston)

truffle	oil	right.	We	make	a	dressing	of	truffle	oil,	white	balsamic	vinegar,	and	whole	grain	mustard.	We
toss	it	over	endive,	crumbled	blue	cheese,	spicy	pecans,	and	raw	cremini	mushrooms.	You	just	can’t	stop
eating	it!
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

On	Selecting	the	Right	Oil

Your	choice	of	olive	oil	always	depends	on	what	you	are	using	it	for.	In	general,	you	don’t	want	an	oil
that	is	super-assertive,	green,	or	peppery.	You	want	a	good	olive	flavor.	I	use	a	100	percent	Italian	blend.
It	is	silly	to	cook	with	100	percent	extra-virgin	olive	oil	if	you	are	just	sautéing	something.	If	the	oil	is
going	to	stay	in	what	you	are	making,	like	a	sauce,	then	start	with	extra-virgin	olive	oil.	When	I	make	a
tomato	sauce,	that	is	what	I	am	starting	with.

If	you	are	finishing	a	dish,	that	is	also	when	you	would	use	an	assertive,	more	full-flavored	oil.	I	also
like	to	use	nut	oils,	especially	those	made	by	Jean	Leblanc.	They	are	insane;	his	oils	are	so	good	that	after
you	taste	them,	nothing	else	will	do!	I	especially	like	to	use	nut	oils	in	the	fall.	I	use	walnut	oil	dressing
on	salads,	especially	those	salads	that	accompany	meat.	If	you	make	a	foie	gras	dish	with	apples	and
endive,	an	addition	of	walnut	oil	would	be	great.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Olive	oil	comes	in	a	wide	variety	of	flavors	and	strengths	even	from	the	same	region,	much	like	wine:

•	I	use	a	heavier	(e.g.,	Puglian,	Umbrian,	Sicilian)	olive	oil	on	bigger-flavored	dishes.	A	strong	olive
oil	goes	well	on	bean	puree	or	a	strong	vegetable	like	dandelion	greens.	In	the	United	States,	you


would	put	a	barbecue	sauce	on	a	grilled	meat;	in	Italy,	you	would	use	a	strong	olive	oil.

•	I	use	a	lighter	(e.g.,	Ligurian,	Tuscan)	olive	oil	on	lighter	meats	like	veal	or	fish	dishes	and	pastas.
A	Ligurian	olive	is	full	and	bright	and	is	great	on	a	lighter	dish.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

•	I	like	to	use	single	varietal	olive	oil	from	Australia	and	New	Zealand.	Australian	olive	oils	can	be
like	their	wines:	big,	pungent,	and	spicy.	New	Zealand	oils	have	a	little	more	depth	of	flavor	and
green	grassiness.

The	onion	family	is	the	basis	for	every	cuisine	I	can	think	of.	Of	course,	Asian	cuisines	use	more	green
onions	and	garlic,	while	the	French	use	more	shallots	and	garlic,	but	it’s	the	onion	family	providing	the
foundation.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

You	can’t	cook	without	onions.	There	is	not	a	single	thing	you	can	do	without	onions.	There	are	so	many
things	made	with	onions	that	when	people	come	in	to	our	restaurant	and	say	that	they	are	allergic	to
onions,	I	say,	“No,	you	are	not	—	it	is	impossible.	You	just	don’t	like	onions.”	People	eat	onions	all	the
time	and	just	don’t	know	it.	I	remember	having	a	conversation	with	[the	artist]	Jasper	Johns,	with	him
saying,	“If	truffles	and	onions	cost	the	same	amount	of	money,	you	would	obviously	choose	an	onion.	You
don’t	need	truffles;	you	do	need	onions.”
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	roast	onions	a	long,	long	time	and	use	them	to	add	a	meaty	flavor	to	soups.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Your	cooking	technique	alters	your	flavors	a	great	deal.	If	you	put	a	lot	of	onions	in	your	curry	but	don’t
sauté	them	enough	first,	you	will	get	a	sweet	flavor.	If	you	sauté	the	onions	until	they	are	almost	burnt	but
not	quite,	your	curry	will	have	more	of	a	roasted-toasted	flavor.

We	use	lots	of	smoked	paprika,	but	need	to	be	careful	because	it	can	be	really	strong.	I	like	to	finish	our
fried	chickpeas	with	this	because	it	makes	them	taste	like	they	just	jumped	out	of	the	fire!	We	also	like	to
mix	our	paprikas	together,	typically	in	equal	proportions	of	sweet,	hot,	and	smoked.	Smoked	paprika	is
primarily	smoky	and	doesn’t	have	a	lot	of	other	flavors.	So	if	you	combine	it	with	a	vibrant	sweet
paprika,	you’ll	get	a	more	rounded	pepper	flavor.	Paprika	is	also	very	regional.	In	the	south	[of	Spain]
where	it	gets	sunshine	and	heat,	you	see	more	smoked	paprika,	but	in	the	north	where	it	is	colder	and
rainy,	they	are	not	into	the	heat.

The	Spanish	use	parsley	stems	for	cooking,	and	fresh	as	a	garnish	before	serving.	When	you	make	rice	or
beans,	you	would	put	a	stem	in.	To	me,	parsley	added	to	fish	or	shellfish	makes	the	dish	tastes	more
“marine,”	as	opposed	to	earthy.	I	love	salsa	verde,	which	is	a	sauce	made	with	basically	a	ton	of	parsley,
garlic,	and	some	kind	of	juice	like	clam	juice.	It’s	wonderful	served	with	fish.

—	ALEXANDRA	RAIJ,	TÍA	POL	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

People	do	not	understand	parsley;	they	think	it	is	green	specks.	But	it	is	wonderful	with	fish.	If	you	make
a	straight-up	linguini	with	clam	sauce,	you	want	a	big	handful	of	chopped	parsley	in	there	—	not	for	the
appearance,	but	for	the	taste.	It	is	an	important	component	in	a	lot	of	dishes	and	needs	to	be	there.	Itcan
also	be	used	as	a	sauce	all	on	its	own.	If	you	sprinkle	it	on	a	steak,	it	will	not	have	the	impact	that	it
would	on	fish.	On	the	other	hand,	if	you	make	a	Maître	d’hôtel	butter	[butter	flavored	with	lemon	juice
and	parsley]	and	put	it	on	the	steak,	the	parsley	has	a	role	there.	On	vegetables,	if	you	make	glazed	carrots
or	pearl	onions	or	a	stew	with	lots	of	vegetables,	parsley	stirred	in	at	the	last	moment	is	good	stuff.	As	for
my	choice	of	parsley,	I	always	use	flat	Italian-style	parsley.

—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Salsa	verde	is	my	favorite	all-purpose	condiment	at	home.	I	like	it	on	fish,	lamb,	and	steak.	It	is	made


with	anchovy,	garlic,	shallots,	olive	oil,	and	herbs	—	primarily	parsley,	but	also	chervil,	chives,
tarragon,	a	little	bit	of	marjoram,	and	sometimes	a	little	mint	if	I	am	in	the	mood.	I	add	the	acid	at	the	last
moment	so	it	won’t	change	the	color	of	the	herbs,	and	will	choose	between	Banyuls	or	red	wine	vinegar,
or	lemon	juice.	If	I	am	serving	meat,	I	will	use	vinegar;	if	I	am	serving	fish,	I	will	use	lemon.	Even	though
it	changes	color	once	the	acid	is	added,	it	lasts	a	few	days.	It	is	really	good	on	a	piece	of	bread	or	with
some	fresh	farmer’s	cheese	as	a	snack.

Pairing	Pastas	with	Sauces
Which	sauces	pair	best	with	which	pastas?	We	asked	chef	Odette	Fada	of	New	York	City’s
San	Domenico	restaurant.

•	Angel	hair:	In	Italy,	angel	hair	pasta	is	served	to	old	people	who	can’t	chew.	It’s	for	grandparents,
or	for	others	to	eat	when	they	are	sick.	The	problem	with	angel	hair	pasta	is	it’s	so	thin	it’s	hard	to
cook	al	dente,	and	I	like	my	pasta	a	little	chewy.

•	Bow	tie:	Fresh	bow	tie	is	great	when	made	by	hand,	because	it	stays	folded	and	doesn’t	open	into	a
square.	I	like	to	serve	it	with	vegetables	and	tomato-based	sauces.

•	Fettuccine:	This	is	a	flavorful	pasta	and	is	good	with	a	Bolognese	sauce.

•	Fusilli:	I	like	their	[corkscrew]	shape,	but	they	tend	to	break	easily	so	they	are	not	that	attractive
when	you	cook	them	in	a	restaurant	setting.	I	like	them	at	home	in	a	salad	or	with	some	pesto	because
the	pesto	sticks	to	it.

•	Hollow	pasta	[e.g.,	macaroni,	penne,	rigatoni]:	Good	with	sauces	that	have	big	chunks	in	them	so
that	the	sauce	pieces	go	inside	whole.	I	like	to	do	penne	with	fresh	peas	because	the	peas	will	slip
inside,	so	you’ll	sometimes	get	a	little	surprise	when	you’re	chewing.

•	Pappardelle:	This	is	a	strong,	rustic	pasta.	I	like	it	with	rabbit	sauce,	a	ragoût,	or	a	fish	sauce	that
has	some	character.

•	Small	pasta	[e.g.,	rice-,	shell-,	or	star-shaped]:	These	are	good	for	soups	and	brothy	dishes.	For
example,	you	would	use	them	with	a	brothy	fish	dish.

•	Spaghetti:	Everything	goes	with	spaghetti!	It	is	a	pasta	that	sauce	sticks	to.	Everything	from	tomato
sauce	to	pesto	to	pecorino	with	black	pepper	is	great	with	spaghetti.
Or,	if	you’re	starting	with	the	sauce:

•	Carbonara:	Spaghetti	or	bucatini,	you	want	a	pasta	that	the	sauce	will	stick	to.

•	Cream:	Fettuccine,	pappardelle,	or	gnocchi,	since	cream	is	so	rich	you	want	a	strong-flavored
pasta	or,	in	the	last	case,	gnocchi	—	one	that	is	made	with	some	egg	in	it.

•	Game:	Pappardelle	or	fettuccine;	you	want	an	egg-rich	pasta	with	some	flavor.

•	Olive	oil	and	garlic:	Spaghetti.

•	Pesto:	Fusilli.

•	Tomato:	This	works	with	almost	all	pasta	shapes,	from	small	to	large.
I	have	played	with	lots	of	flavored	pasta	doughs.	One	of	my	favorites	is	olive	because	it
holds	its	flavor.	Other	flavors	that	hold	up	well	are	squid	ink	and	saffron.	I	have	also	made	a
pappardelle	with	cocoa	powder	that	I	paired	with	game	sauce	that	worked	great.	If	you
wanted	to	achieve	a	particular	color,	you	could	create	red	pasta	with	beets,	green	pasta


with	spinach,	and	black	pasta	with	squid	ink.

Chef	Odette	Fada	of	New	York’s	San	Domenico	on	Making
Ravioli
I	love	ravioli!	Anything	and	everything	goes	in	my	ravioli	—	I	have	used	everything	from
chestnuts	to	cheese	to	fish,	meat,	and	vegetables.	You	can	vary	the	ravioli	dough	as	well	as
the	stuffing.	For	example,	I	serve	ravioli	stuffed	with	sea	urchin	and	the	dough	is	light	and
made	with	just	flour	and	water.	For	a	stronger	filling	like	lamb,	I	will	use	some	egg	in	the
dough	which	makes	it	bigger	flavored.	One	of	my	favorite	ravioli	stuffings	is	black	truffle	and
pancetta.	The	truffle	provides	a	crunchiness	when	you	bite	into	it.

One	of	the	greatest	ravioli	we	do	dates	back	to	the	chef	for	the	last	king	of	Italy	at	the
beginning	of	the	twentieth	century.	It	is	stuffed	with	spinach,	truffle,	Parmesan	cheese,	and
an	egg	yolk,	and	served	with	butter,	truffle,	and	Parmesan	cheese.	When	the	ravioli	is
cooked,	it	is	served	with	the	yolk	warm	but	not	cooked.	It	is	truly	an	amazing	dish.

In	Italy	during	the	winter,	you	would	typically	have	some	slices	of	sausage	on	top	of	a

plate	of	lentils.	I	decided	to	combine	the	two	into	a	ravioli	dish.	Now,	one	of	my	other
favorite	dishes	is	our	ravioli	stuffed	with	cotechino	[sausage]	and	lentils.	The	lentils	are
cooked	with	rosemary,	garlic,	extra-virgin	olive	oil,	and	prosciutto	skin,	and	go	into	the
ravioli	with	the	sausage,	parsley,	and	Parmesan	cheese.	The	dish	is	finished	with	some
strong	extra-virgin	olive	oil,	parsley,	and	a	crack	of	pepper.

When	I	think	of	the	essence	of	peaches,	it’s	their	smell	—	so	I	think	of	echoing	that	with	the	floralness	of
Moscato	d’Asti.	I’ll	add	acidity,	sweetness,	and	a	little	fat,	such	as	through	crème	fraîche.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	try	not	to	cook	peaches,	or	if	I	do,	only	for	a	short	amount	of	time.	A	peach	pie	never	tastes	asgood	to
me	as	a	blueberry	pie,	because	it	tastes	too	cooked	by	the	time	you	get	it	thick	enough.	So	if	I	get	peaches,
I’ll	chop	them	up	and	put	them	on	a	tart	shell	that	is	already	cooked	instead.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	like	peaches	with	rich,	round	flavors	like	vanilla	and	honey.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Japanese	baby	peaches	are	tiny	peaches	about	the	size	of	olives.	We	wanted	to	showcase	the	peaches	and
thought,	What	do	peaches	go	with?	Cream.	We	took	that	one	step	further	and	used	yogurt	instead.	So	we
chose	Greek	yogurt,	paired	it	with	the	peaches,	then	garnished	the	dish	with	Hawaiian	pink	sea	salt,
Greek	olive	oil,	reduced	balsamic	vinegar,	and	micro	mint.	We	turned	the	water	strained	from	the	yogurt


into	“air”	[foam].	This	is	a	dish	that	we	serve	as	a	pre-dessert	and	it	works	well	because	it	is	sweet	and
savory.

them	on	a	lot	of	things	and	they	pair	well.	Milk	chocolate	and	peanuts	work	really	well	together.	Peanuts
pair	great	with	bananas,	especially	if	you	cover	the	banana	in	chocolate	and	then	roll	it	in	peanuts	and

Borage	flowers:	Eating	a	borage	flower	is	like	eating	an	oyster!	It	is	briny.	In	the
summer	when	they	are	in	season,	if	you	taste	a	couple	it	is	reminiscent	of	a	mild	oyster.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Apples	are	more	popular	than	pears	because	when	you	go	to	the	store,	pears	are	all	hard.	You	buy	them,
bring	them	home,	and	wait	forever	for	them	to	ripen.	You	have	to	have	a	premeditated	use	for	pears.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	like	pears	poached	because	I’m	not	fond	of	their	texture.	I	also	make	a	pear	tart	with	pears	poached	in
lemon	zest	and	vanilla,	and	then	combined	with	custard,	honey,	lemon,	and	vanilla.	It	is	paired	with	a
honey	grappa	zabaglione	and	topped	with	grated	Pecorino	Toscano	cheese	grated	over	it	as	if	it	were
pasta.	The	dish	sounds	a	little	crazy	but	all	these	flavors	are	classic	combinations	found	in	Italy.	Pears	are
often	infused	with	grappa	in	the	north	of	Italy.	Pears,	honey,	and	pecorino	is	a	classic	combination	in
Tuscany.	Pecorino	goes	with	every	flavor.	Honey	carries	all	the	flavors	forward.

I	like	white	pepper	with	most	white	fish,	and	black	pepper	with	tuna	and	red	meat.	White	pepper	works
with	halibut	because	it	does	not	overwhelm	the	fish.	Black	pepper	has	a	complex	flavor	and	is	spicy,
which	can	be	distracting.	The	problem	with	many	peppers	like	cayenne	or	chipotle	is	that	they	are	so
strong	they	can	burn.	That	is	not	a	problem	for	me,	but	it	is	for	our	clientele.	We	use	piment	d’Espelette,
which	is	spicy	but	sweet.
—	ERIC	RIPERT,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

You	have	to	be	careful	with	black	pepper	because	it	can	be	a	vehicle	to	add	flavor	—	but	if	misused,	it
will	mask	flavor.	I	might	add	the	tiniest	little	pinch	before	a	dessert	gets	served	to	punch	it	up.	I	use	black
pepper	with	fresh	fruit,	especially	cherries.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

To	me,	tuna	doesn’t	even	taste	like	tuna	anymore	unless	it’s	seared	with	my	pepper	mix	of	toasted	and
ground	black	and	pink	peppercorns,	coriander,	and	star	anise.	The	same	mix	is	also	great	on	beef,	buffalo,
and	venison.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

We	don’t	have	sixteen	types	of	pepper	here;	we	use	a	basic	black	Tellicherry	peppercorn	and	a	little	bit
of	red	pepper	flakes.	I	will	occasionally	go	to	an	Asian	market	to	get	a	pepper	that	has	a	sweet	element	to
it,	as	these	also	tend	to	have	a	fruitiness	to	them	that	works	well	in	braised	dishes.

Peppadew	peppers,	which	are	from	South	Africa,	started	coming	to	the	U.S.	just	a	few	years

ago.	I	stuff	them	with	goat	cheese	and	wrap	them	in	Serrano	ham	before	frying	them.	You	get
sweetness	and	spice	from	the	peppers,	saltiness	from	the	ham,	creaminess	from	the	cheese,
and	crunchiness	from	the	frying.	Doing	so	gives	them	so	much	flavor,	I	don’t	need	to	add

Guindilla	peppers	are	used	to	give	heat	in	Spanish	cooking.	If	you	were	cooking	beans,	you

would	add	your	parsley	sprig,	half	an	onion,	garlic,	carrot,	and	one	guindilla	pepper.	Nora
peppers	are	smoked,	bell-shaped	peppers	from	Catalonia	used	for	romesco	sauce.	They	are
similar	to	Mexican	guajillo	peppers.	Chorizero	peppers	are	bittersweet.	Their	pulp	is	used
in	salsa	vizcaina,	which	is	a	red	sauce	made	with	a	lot	of	onions	cooked	down	sweet,	the


chorizero	pepper	pulp,	and	either	fish	or	bean	stock.	It’s	great	served	on	fish	or	tripe.

Because	of	the	texture	and	unique	flavor	of	a	persimmon,	no	matter	what	you	do	it	will	always	taste	like
persimmon	pudding.	I	decided	two	years	ago	to	stop	trying	to	do	anything	else	with	persimmons.	Why	try
and	reinvent	the	wheel?	To	work	with	persimmons,	you	first	put	them	in	the	freezer	overnight	to	ripen,
then	peel	and	puree	them.	Persimmons	are	pretty	astringent,	so	you	need	to	add	a	lot	of	spices	and	sugar	to
them.	The	combination	of	allspice,	cinnamon,	and	ginger	that	you	see	in	traditional	recipes	is	nice	with
persimmons,	and	adds	an	interesting	complexity	to	the	flavor.

PICKLES

I	lived	in	Japan	for	two	years	where	I	fell	in	love	with	pickles	and	pickling.	For	pickling,	I	use	the
proportions	that	are	common	for	seasoning	Japanese	sushi	rice,	though	I’ll	admit	that	there	might	be	a
sushi	chef	out	there	who	might	disagree	with	me:	9	parts	vinegar	to	5	parts	sugar,	1	part	salt,	and	1	part
water.	Pickles	are	one	of	those	things	I	love	to	have	in	my	pantry	because	they	are	so	fun	to	use	and	make
so	many	things	yummy.	It	is	definitely	one	of	my	tricks	that	I	keep	stashed	away.	I	like	to	pickle	Swiss
chard	stems	with	raw	beets	and	star	anise.	They	are	great	together	and	work	as	a	garnish	on	our	Nantucket
Bay	scallop	dish.

PIMENTON	(See	also	Paprika)

I	don’t	even	like	to	use	the	word	“paprika”	when	referring	to	pimenton.	It	is	not	the	same	as	Hungarian
paprika,	which	is	just	dried	pepper	and	doesn’t	taste	like	anything	else.	The	Spanish	were	the	first	to
plant	peppers.	Our	pimenton	has	the	right	touch	of	sweetness,	bitterness,	and	smoke.	Used	in	a	dish	it
makes	the	dish	a	whole	new	thing.	Sprinkled	on	octopus,	it	is	astonishing.

Pineapple	is	80	to	90	percent	water.	We’ll	freeze	the	pineapple,	then	pull	it	out	and	put	it	in	a	colander,
and	let	the	juice	run	out	of	it	—	which	has	all	the	flavor	of	the	pineapple.	After	pressing	out	all	thjuice,
we’ll	throw	out	the	now-flavorless	pulp,	and	use	just	the	juice.	You	can	do	the	same	with	strawberries	or
other	fruits	to	obtain	a	clear	juice,	which	you	can	use	in	drinks	or,	frozen	and	scraped,	as	fruit	crystals	to

Heat	[aka	piquancy]	can	come	from	a	grind	of	black	pepper	when	you	are	cooking,	or	at	the	last	second
on	top	of	a	salad	before	it	goes	out.	Heat	can	also	come	from	some	jalapeño	in	steamed	cockles	with
ginger	and	lemongrass.	In	either	case,	heat	adds	a	brightness	to	the	dish.

A	Checkerboard	Terrine	of	Pistachio	and	White	Chocolate	Ice	Cream	with	Blackberry
Sauce
—	Patrick	O’Connell,	The	Inn	at	Little	Washington	(Washington,	Virginia)

Pistachios	are	a	distinctively	flavored	nut.	You	need	to	be	sure	that	what	you	pair	with	them	will	stand
up.	They	go	well	with	raspberries	but	not	strawberries	because	the	latter	are	softer	in	flavor.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Pistachios	look	great	with	other	nuts	because	you	get	green	and	brown	alongside	each	other.	They	can	be
pretty	mild	so	they	are	less	about	flavor	and	more	about	color	and	texture.	Since	pistachios	are	so	mild	I
like	to	feature	them	solo	or	in	a	large	quantity	so	they	don’t	get	lost.	I	make	a	chocolate	semifreddo	and
there	is	pistachio	in	the	semifreddo,	there	is	pistachio	paste,	they	are	on	the	plate,	and	they	are	in	the
sauce.	They	are	front	and	center.

What	is	nice	about	pomegranates	is	that	they	are	very	flavorful	but	don’t	have	a	lot	of	sugar	in	them.
They	also	have	a	unique	flavor	that	is	not	like	anything	else.	It	is	one	of	the	few	flavors	that	have	come
around	in	popularity	because	they	have	made	it	easier	to	use	[via	pomegranate	juice,	molasses,	etc.].
Cleaning	them	to	use	just	the	seeds	can	be	a	pain	in	the	neck.	However,	I	use	the	juice	because	it	makes	a
great	sorbet.

You’ll	often	see	what	is	essentially	clam	chowder	[without	the	clams]	used	as	a	sauce:	the	combination	of
pork	—	whether	it’s	bacon,	chorizo,	or	whatever	—	and	thyme,	served	with	potatoes	and	cream.	It	could
be	served	with	something	poached	or	sautéed.	It	is	a	cute	reworking	of	something	that	is	classic.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	like	the	combination	of	pork	with	fruit.	With	a	pork	chop,	fresh	and	dried	figs	or	strawberries	would	all
work.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

Sauces	often	don’t	do	justice	to	the	meat	they’re	saucing.	For	that	reason,	we	don’t	use	veal	stock	with
pork,	which	hides	the	flavor	of	the	meat.	Instead,	we	want	to	do	everything	we	can	to	emphasize	the
flavor	of	the	pork	itself.	So,	we’ll	roast	the	pork	scraps	and	bones	and	make	a	pork	stock	instead.	In	the
summertime,	to	keep	it	light,	we	won’t	even	add	wine.

I’m	sometimes	inspired	by	looking	back	to	my	childhood	and	the	combinations	of	flavors	I	liked.	I	was	a
pretty	picky	eater	growing	up,	but	I	loved	my	macaroni	and	cheese,	and	bacon	and	eggs.	I	came	up	with	a
take	on	bacon	and	eggs	substituting	pork	belly	for	the	bacon.	I	love	pork	belly	—	it	is	a	poor	man’s	foie
gras,	the	way	it	just	melts	in	your	mouth.	I	make	the	eggs	in	a	double	boiler	that	gives	them	a	creamy
texture,	and	finish	them	with	fresh	herbs.	For	the	belly,	we	grill	it	and	then	braise	it	in	citrus,	champagne
vinegar,	and	veal	stock	for	six	hours.	Then	at	serving,	we	grill	it	again	and	top	it	with	a	“sweet	heat”
sauce	which	is	like	a	barbecue	sauce	with	layers	and	layers	of	flavor.

With	pumpkin	or	even	sweet	potatoes,	the	combination	of	allspice,	cinnamon,	ginger,	and	clove	works
great.	If	you	buy	canned	pumpkin	that	has	spices	already	added,	it	tastes	a	little	off	and	artificial.
Depending	on	how	you	like	your	spices,	you	typically	add	equal	amounts	of	ginger	and	cinnamon	and	less
allspice	and	clove	because	the	last	two	are	very	strong.


—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Pumpkin	and	butternut	squash	juices	are	great	in	dishes	featuring	[each	respective	vegetable].	What	the
juice	does	is	intensify	their	flavor,	making	the	dishes	taste	more	natural.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	had	to	come	up	with	a	recipe	for	a	vegan	cookbook,	and	ended	up	making	a	pumpkin	and	coconut	milk
custard	thickened	with	agar-agar	that	was	so	delicious,	I	put	it	on	the	menu!
—	BRADFORD	THOMPSON,	MARY	ELAINE’S	AT	THE	PHOENICIAN	(SCOTTSDALE,	ARIZONA)

Pumpkin	and	bay	leaf	together	make	the	pumpkin	taste	even	more	pumpkin-like.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

My	pumpkin	pie	soup	dish	was	inspired	by	walking	through	Whole	Foods	and	seeing	pumpkins.	I	thought,
How	do	I	like	my	pumpkin?	I	like	pumpkin	pie,	and	thought	it	would	actually	make	an	interesting	soup.	I
made	a	pumpkin	soup	and	found	the	soup	to	be	very	savory	with	its	spicing,	and	added	smoked	duck	to	it.
I	wanted	a	contrasting	flavor,	so	I	added	some	sweet	meringue	as	a	garnish.	Then	I	needed	a	contrast	to
the	creaminess,	so	I	put	in	a	piece	of	pie	crust	a	second	before	serving	as	well	as	toasted	pecans	for	even
more	crunch.

A	dish	I	am	really	proud	of	is	our	saddle	of	rabbit	served	with	green	olives,	shallots,	marjoram,	and
fennel	jam.	This	is	a	light	and	beautifully	balanced	dish	that	reminds	me	of	Liguria	[in	Italy].	The	olives
are	salty,	the	marjoram	is	strong,	and	the	fennel	is	sweet.	This	has	been	on	our	menu	for	over	a	year	but	it
took	me	a	few	tries	to	get	right.	I	tried	black	olives,	but	they	were	too	strong.	I	tried	rosemary,	but	it	was
too	earthy.	I	tried	Brussels	sprouts,	but	they	were	a	little	too	bitter	and	didn’t	complement	the	same	way
sweet	fennel	did.	So	though	the	combination	didn’t	work	for	the	saddle,	the	black	olives	and	rosemary	led
me	to	add	some	rabbit	liver	and	stuff	a	whole	boned	rabbit.	That	dish	did	work.	The	two	dishes	were
different	in	the	sense	that	the	saddle	with	the	green	olives	was	a	little	more	sophisticated	while	the	whole
rabbit	was	more	of	a	peasant	dish.	Customers	like	both!

I	came	up	with	a	radish	salad	served	with	lobster.	We	blanch	turnip	rounds	and	fold	in	a	little	baby	ginger
to	get	this	wonderfully	peppery	salad.	The	sauce	with	the	lobster	is	a	pistachio	vinaigrette	that	is	bound
by	onion	puree	and	brightened	by	the	juice	that	pickled	the	ginger.	We	finish	the	dish	with	toasted
pistachios	and	add	a	pistachio	oil.	The	pistachio	nut	and	oil	add	an	earthy	quality	and	depth	of	flavor	to
the	dish.

When	working	with	raspberries,	I	will	try	not	to	cook	them	too	much.	The	problem	is	that	often	fresh
raspberries	are	not	that	great.	If	I	am	making	a	sauce,	even	in	the	middle	of	summer	I	will	use	frozen
raspberries.	You	can	use	frozen	fruit	as	long	as	it	doesn’t	have	sugar	or	anything	else	added.	The	fruit	is
picked	in	the	field	when	it	is	ripe	and	frozen	right	away.	So,	the	frozen	raspberries	will	have	better	flavor
than	those	that	have	been	put	in	a	little	carton	and	shipped	across	the	country.	Of	course,	local	farmers’
market	raspberries	are	a	different	story.	If	I	am	making	a	sauce	in	the	summer,	the	frozen	raspberries	will
taste	great.	On	the	other	hand,	you	would	not	use	frozen	raspberries	on	top	of	a	tart.

I	like	to	pair	rhubarb,	caramelized	sugar,	and	blood	orange	juice	—	which	has	more	character	than
orange	juice	—	because	their	seasons	barely	overlap.	I	am	not	a	fan	of	rhubarb	desserts	because	they
always	tend	to	be	one	note	—	either	very	tart,	or	very	sweet	to	make	up	for	the	tartness.	Caramel	works
well	with	rhubarb	because	it	makes	the	rhubarb	not	too	sweet.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

There	is	not	a	lot	of	fruit	available	in	the	spring,	so	that	pretty	much	leaves	you	with	rhubarb.	The	good
news	is	that	rhubarb	works	well	in	custards	and	ice	creams.

Odette	Fada	of	New	York’s	San	Domenico	on	Risotto
I	am	from	Northern	Italy	and	grew	up	eating	risotto.	Back	then,	we	mainly	ate	risotto
Milanese	[i.e.,	saffron	risotto,	traditionally	served	with	osso	buco	or	with	a	mild	pork
sausage	crumbled	in	with	some	rosemary].	We	would	also	put	it	in	soup	—	or	even	just	eat
it	simply	with	some	grated	cheese.

I	love	it	because	it	only	takes	one	pan,	and	it	is	ready	in	20	minutes!	People	think	it
takes	a	long	time	but	if	you	were	to	cook	a	piece	of	fish,	wash	greens,	and	make	a	salad
dressing,	that	would	take	just	as	long.

You	can	make	risotto	with	almost	anything.	I	love	it	with	fruit,	vegetables,	or	fish.	One	of

my	favorite	fruit	risottos	is	a	seasonal	one	with	pears	and	Gorgonzola.	The	pears	give	a
nice,	sweet	crunch	to	the	dish.	I	also	like	making	risotto	with	Prosecco,	strawberries,	and
nettles.

A	classic	combination	in	Italy	in	fall	is	game	with	blueberry	jam	and	mushrooms.	I	have

adapted	this	and	for	over	twenty	years	have	been	serving	risotto	with	porcini	mushrooms
and	blueberries	tossed	in	at	the	last	second.

I	also	like	to	make	a	risotto	with	fresh	herbs	like	rosemary,	thyme,	or	oregano	—	and
then	at	the	end	I’ll	cover	it	with	an	extra-thin	slice	of	lard	[pork	jowl]	that	has	a	mild	flavor.	It
just	melts	into	the	risotto	and	is	out	of	this	world.
Each	ingredient	you	add	to	your	risotto	will	dictate	when	it	should	be	added.	If	it	is
something	delicate	like	a	berry,	it	gets	added	very	late	so	it	will	not	break	up.	If	you	are
making	a	seafood	risotto	—	say,	with	octopus	—	it	should	be	added	early	so	it	has	time	to
cook	all	the	way	through.

—	Brad	Farmerie,	Public	(New	York	City)

Floral	flavors,	when	done	well,	can	be	really	amazing.	This	is	also	special	because	it	is	something	that	I
never	grew	up	with.	Someone	from	India	may	not	find	it	a	big	deal.

I	tend	to	think	in	threes.	I’ll	pair	two	classic	ingredients,	and	add	a	third	to	elevate	the	combination.	I
make	my	own	rose-flavored	dessert	that	was	inspired	by	[French	pastry	chef]	Pierre	Hermé	and	his	rose
macaroon	with	raspberry	and	lychee,	which	is	one	of	the	greatest	things	I	have	tasted	in	my	life.	I	coat	a
standard	tart	shell	with	a	layer	of	liquid	raspberry;	on	top	of	that	I	place	a	rose	parfait,	which	I	pair	with
lemon	and	pistachio.	To	make	the	rose	flavor	not	so	overbearing,	I	use	it	in	three	different	forms.	I	infuse
rosebuds	[used	to	make	rosewater]	in	the	milk	for	the	parfait,	and	I	also	use	rose	syrup,	which	adds	color
and	sweetness,	and	finally	rosewater	as	well.	You	have	to	be	careful	with	rose	because	it	can	be	like
eating	perfume.	That	is	why	I	take	a	lot	of	care	using	three	layers	to	make	it	one	flavor.

Rosemary	has	a	strong	flavor,	so	it’s	always	going	to	be	the	star.	It	works	with	strong,	assertive	fish	like
swordfish	or	tuna	—	and,	of	course,	it	is	a	classic	with	lamb.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Rosemary	works	with	apples	or	pears.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

When	I	think	of	rosemary,	I	think	of	octopus.	It	works	so	well	in	a	ceviche	with	octopus,	black	olives,
and	potato.
—	KATSUYA	FUKUSHIMA,	MINIBAR	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Rosemary	can	be	strong	with	seafood	unless	it	is	a	full-flavored	seafood.	We	will	skewer	mussels	with
rosemary	and	panfry	them	because	they	work	with	the	piney	flavor	of	the	mussels.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

—	JERRI	BANKS,	COCKTAIL	CONSULTANT	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	the	combination	of	rum	with	carrots.	Carrot	juice	provides	a	bright	color	that	sends	a	message,
especially	to	women.	It	has	its	own	natural	sweetness,	and	a	little	goes	a	long	way.	Carrots	go	beautifully
with	lemon	thyme	and	orange,	but	I	especially	love	the	combination	of	carrots	and	ginger.	In	the	autumn
months,	I’ll	combine	gold	rum	with	carrot	and	apple	juices	and	autumn	spices.	I’ll	infuse	allspice,
cinnamon,	and	nutmeg	into	a	tea	or	tisane,	and	add	that	to	the	cocktail.

Saffron	Panna	Cotta	with	“Agrumi	Misti”	and	Blood	Orange	Sorbetto
—	Gina	DePalma,	pastry	chef,	Babbo	(New	York	City)

I	would	definitely	have	saffron	on	hand	for	Spanish	cooking.	It	lends	itself	to	rice,	seafood,	meat,	and
poultry.	You	can	combine	saffron	and	salt	together	for	a	saffron	salt	that	is	incredibly	aromatic.	Saffron
also	works	very	well	on	a	salad.	People	forget	that	saffron	is	a	flower	and,	sprinkled	on	a	salad,	it
aromatizes	the	greens.
—	JOSÉ	ANDRÉS,	CAFÉ	ATLÁNTICO	(WASHINGTON,	DC)


Saffron	has	a	sweet	power.	It	is	a	classic	flavor	to	add	to	shellfish,	but	the	minute	you	taste	the	saffron	in
a	dish,	there	is	too	much.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	wanted	to	come	up	with	a	panna	cotta	that	was	unlike	anyone	else’s.	I	was	walking	down	the	street
thinking	of	Italian	dishes	and	risotto	Milanese	[which	is	made	with	saffron]	came	to	mind.	This	led	me	to
think	about	saffron,	and	the	idea	of	adding	saffron	to	my	panna	cotta.	After	Ruth	Reichl	mentioned	it	in
the	New	York	Times	review	of	Babbo,	Mario	[Batali]	told	me	I	could	never	take	it	off	the	menu!

Saffron	has	a	bright	metallic	flavor,	and	with	quince	—	which	is	floral,	delicate,	and	perfumed	—	it	is
wonderful.	Over	the	years,	I	have	found	that	saffron	unexpectedly	changes	its	flavor	depending	on	what
fruit	is	paired	with	it.	Each	fruit	I	work	with	either	turns	up	its	floral	component	or	its	metallic	flavor.
Saffron	is	great	with	stone	fruits	like	apples,	peaches,	pears,	plums,	and	figs.	It	also	works	with	citrus
like	blood	oranges,	kumquats,	and	grapefruit.	On	the	other	hand,	it	doesn’t	work	with	many	berries.	It
makes	strawberries	a	little	flat,	and	is	downright	awful	with	cranberries.

Every	salad	should	have	elements	of	bitter,	salt,	heat,	and	texture.	For	us,	the	bitter	component	is	often	the
greens.	We	use	a	lot	of	frisée,	radicchio,	and	endive.	But	there	always	needs	to	be	some	crunch	in	a	salad.
Even	if	it	is	a	delicate	salad,	you	need	to	find	a	way	to	get	a	crunch	in	there.	For	a	delicate	salad,	you	can
get	crunch	using	fried	shallot	rings	or	crispy	sage	leaves.	We	often	use	nuts	for	crunch.	Our	leaf	salad	has
a	cashew	brittle,	which	is	made	by	caramelizing	sugar	then	seasoning	it	with	salt,	black	pepper,	a	hint	of
madras	curry,	a	pinch	of	our	Moroccan	spice	blend	(eighteen	ingredients),	and	a	pinch	of	pepper	mix
(four	ingredients)	before	tossing	the	nuts	in.	The	other	components	of	the	salad	are	pomegranate	seeds,
bacon,	and	a	South	American	blue	cheese.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

When	you	are	eating	a	salad,	the	greens	are	the	main	ingredient,	so	whatever	you	add	has	to	elevate	them.
Lettuce	is	boring	by	itself,	so	you	elevate	it	with	the	vinaigrette.	We	will	use	herbs	in	our	salads,	but	they
must	not	overpower	the	greens;	they	have	to	be	very	subtle	and	used	in	small	amounts.	We	will	use	chives
or	fresh	parsley	leaves	or	a	combination	of	the	two.	We	may	also	add	some	mint	to	the	mix	because	it


pushes	the	flavors	of	the	greens.

King	White	Salmon	by	Gabriel	Kreuther	of	New	York	City’s
The	Modern

The	salmon	is	roasted,	and	served	with	warm,	slightly	charred	cucumbers,	which	I	like
because	they	are	rarely	used	cooked.	We	use	market	vegetables	that	right	now	are	bok
choy	and	peas.	I	have	added	some	trout	caviar	for	a	briny	flavor	because	salmon	is	on	the
sweet	side.	The	dish	is	then	finished	with	a	hickory	broth.

For	the	hickory	broth,	we	smoke	some	hickory	chips,	wrap	them	in	cheesecloth	with
juniper	berries	and	peppercorns,	and	then	submerge	them	in	water	to	make	a	broth.	This
creates	a	smoked	sauce	that	is	light	and	tasty.	What	we	have	here	is	a	“wood	stock”	that
makes	perfect	sense	with	the	salmon	because	so	often	salmon	is	smoked.	After	the	wood


comes	out,	you	taste	the	broth	to	adjust	it.	It	may	need	some	more	water	to	cut	the	wood
and	smoke	flavor,	or	it	might	need	to	be	reduced	to	intensify	it.	We	finish	the	sauce	with	a
little	half-and-half,	and	foam	it	with	a	handheld	mixer.

Vitaly	Paley	of	Portland’s	Paley’s	Place	on	Cooking	Salmon
on	a	Plank

Salmon	is	a	big	part	of	cooking	in	the	Northwest.	We	get	ours	anywhere	from	Oregon	up	to
Alaska.

The	first	cooking	process	that	comes	to	mind	in	this	part	of	the	country	is	called	cedar

planking,	which	is	a	Native	American	technique.	You	see	planking	in	all	the	best	cooking
catalogs,	but	the	problem	is	that	you	cook	the	fish,	throw	it	out,	and	keep	the	plank
because	the	plank	is	inevitably	more	expensive	than	the	fish!	So	here	is	one	tip:	Instead,	do
what	we	do	and	go	to	a	lumber	yard	and	pick	up	untreated	cedar	shingles.	They	come	in	a
huge	bundle	for	$16.

To	get	the	most	out	of	plank	cooking,	the	salmon	needs	to	be	brined	or	marinated.	I
have	two	favorite	marinades	—	one	that	is	wet,	and	one	that	is	dry.	The	wet	marinade	is	a
60/40	mixture	of	soy	sauce	and	cream	sherry,	lots	of	sliced	ginger,	heads	of	garlic	cut	in
half,	and	chopped	scallions.	The	sherry	adds	just	a	touch	of	sweetness	to	the	fish,	which	I
like.	Let	the	fish	sit	in	that	marinade	for	a	couple	of	hours	and	then	it	is	ready	to	take	on	the
smoke.

The	dry	marinade	is	a	more	traditional	marinade	of	a	60/40	ratio	of	brown	sugar	and

salt	with	orange	zest	[grated]	on	a	microplane	[fine	grater].	I	mix	this	all	together	and
lavishly	rub	it	over	a	salmon	with	the	skin	on,	which	protects	it	from	getting	too	salty	or
sweet.	The	sugar	in	this	rub	balances	out	the	salt	and	adds	another	dimension	to	the	fish
with	caramelization	happening	a	lot	quicker.	The	sweetness	is	almost	hidden;	it	is	that
“What’s-that-flavor?”	aspect	to	the	fish.	Marinate	for	a	couple	of	hours,	then	wipe	off	the
rub	slightly,	and	it	is	ready	to	go.	The	60/40	ratio	of	sugar	to	salt	is	good	because	it	is
pretty	forgiving	if	you	leave	the	fish	in	the	marinade	a	half	hour	too	long.

I	recommend	brushing	the	plank	lightly	with	some	olive	oil,	throwing	it	on	a	hot	grill,
putting	the	fish	on,	and	letting	it	catch	on	fire,	because	when	the	plank	is	on	fire,	that	is	the
flavor	you	are	looking	for.	When	the	burning	plank	gets	close	to	the	fish,	cover	the	grill	to
smother	the	fire	and	let	the	smoke	do	the	rest	of	the	work.

Salmon	has	been	my	favorite	fish	since	I	learned	to	cook	it	correctly.	It	is	so	versatile:	you	can	smoke	it,
marinate	it,	or	even	serve	it	raw.	Because	it	is	rich	and	fatty,	it	pairs	well	with	everything	from	a	red	wine
sauce	to	a	simple	vinaigrette.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Tomato	and	pineapple	with	salmon:	This	dish	goes	back	to	1975	when	someone	gave	me	a	salad	of
tomato	and	pineapple.	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do	with	it,	so	I	stored	the	idea	away.	Today,	I	will	cook	the
tomato,	pineapple,	a	dash	of	white	wine	for	acid,	miso,	and	the	salmon	head,	which	bridges	and	brings	the


flavors	together.	Tomato	gets	fruitier	when	cooked	with	pineapple.	The	end	result	doesn’t	taste	like	either
tomato	or	pineapple;	it	is	a	new	flavor.	This	sauce	is	perfect	with	salmon.

I	love	combining	fruit	and	proteins.	I	am	one-half	Hawaiian,	and	in	Hawaiian	cooking	a	classic	dish	is
Spam	cooked	with	fresh	pineapple.	I	grew	up	with	my	father	making	it	for	us,	and	it	is	delicious.	You’ll
also	see	a	lot	of	sushi	chefs	combine	kiwi	and	scallops,	as	fruit	adds	a	nice	cleansing	note	to	the	protein
you	are	working	with.	Our	take	on	this	combination	is	pineapple	salmon	with	avocado	and	quinoa.	We	cut
pineapple	very	thin,	then	wrap	it	around	salmon	belly,	which	is	very	rich.	When	we	cook	it,	the	pineapple
gets	caramelized	and	helps	cut	the	fat	of	the	salmon.	On	the	dish	is	a	sweet-hot	sauce	of	avocado,	honey,
scallions,	and	serrano	chiles.	To	garnish	the	dish	and	add	some	crunch	we	add	quinoa	that	is	cooked	then
dried	for	three	days	before	cooking	it	in	olive	oil,	which	makes	it	puff	like	Rice	Krispies.

I	like	to	use	Hawaiian	salt	on	a	dish	where	I	want	a	little	crunch.	This	holds	up	better	than	other	salts	that
will	dissolve	more	quickly.	I	will	use	it	on	ceviche,	which	has	a	little	broth.

The	Danish	smoked	salt	we	use	is	smoked	over	Chardonnay	vines.	For	us,	using	smoked	salt	provides
the	flavor	of	cooking	over	grape	vines	as	they	do	in	Spain.	Smoked	salt	is	also	great	if	you	don’t	have	a
grill,	because	even	a	gas	grill	can’t	provide	a	smoky	flavor.	I	like	smoked	salt	sprinkled	on	sardines,


which	in	Spain	will	be	cooked	over	a	fire	on	the	beach	where	they	get	really	smoky.	I	can	give	that	sense
of	place	by	using	this	salt	on	my	sardines.

If	you	have	a	piece	of	Ibérico	or	Serrano	ham	in	your	refrigerator,	you’ll	eventually	end	up	with	this	little
end	of	dried-out	salt-cured	meat.	While	some	might	just	throw	it	away,	we	know	there’s	a	lot	of	flavor	left
—	so	we	grind	it	up	in	a	coffee	grinder	and	use	it	as	meat-flavored	salt.	We	call	this	“ham	salt,”	and	will
use	this	on	a	salad	to	emphasize	the	aroma	and	flavor	of	pork.	.	.	.	In	Spain	we	have	mojama,	which	is
tuna	loin	cured	like	ham.	We’ll	grind	it	up	in	a	coffee	grinder	and	it	becomes	tuna	salt.	When	I	sear	tuna,	I
will	sprinkle	this	on	and	emphasize	the	tuna	with	its	own	tuna	flavor.	It	is	simple	and	dramatic.	I	even
showed	this	technique	to	the	owner	of	the	best	tuna	restaurant	in	the	world	—	called	El	Campero	in
Barbate,	Spain	—	where	he	serves	tuna	a	hundred	ways.	He	loved	it!
—	JOSÉ	ANDRÉS,	CAFÉ	ATLÁNTICO	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

We	use	three	different	kinds	of	salt	—	but	we	also	use	capers,	anchovies,	olives,	preserved	lemons,	and
even	prosciutto	for	adding	another	dimension	of	saltiness.	Even	when	using	these	other	salty	components,
99	percent	of	the	time	we’ll	use	them	in	addition	to	salt,	not	instead	of	it.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)


Chefs	on	Selecting	and	Using	Salt
Kosher	salt	has	larger,	harder	crystals	and	won’t	break	down	too	fast.	I	use	this	for	pasta
water,	brining,	curing	meat,	and	charcuterie.	I	use	French	sea	salt	(esp.	Baleine)	for
general	seasoning.	I	like	Maldon	salt	a	lot.	This	is	what	I	use	for	finishing	dishes.	It	has	a
really	fine	crystal	and	the	flavor	is	great.	It	even	gives	some	crunch	and	melts	like
snowflakes.	It	is	great	sprinkled	on	raw	fish.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Salt	is	now	used	very	often	in	desserts	and	unfortunately	it	doesn’t	always	make	sense.	I
was	served	a	green	apple	sorbet	with	salt	and	it	didn’t	work.	Salt	does	work	on	sweet
oranges,	though.	If	you	cut	a	Cara	Cara	orange	into	wedges	and	sprinkle	sea	salt	on
them,	they	are	delicious.	Salt	also	makes	sense	with	caramel	and	butterscotch.	The	salt	is
a	contrast	to	the	super	sweet,	which	is	why	we	like	PayDay	candy	bars.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	use	Maldon	salt	flakes	as	a	salt	for	finishing	dishes,	and	kosher	salt	for	blanching	water
or	when	I	roast	on	salt.	I’ll	sometimes	use	smoked	salt	with	raw	fish	or	in	a	brine	for	pork,
but	it’s	really	strong	so	you	have	to	be	careful	with	it.
—	BRADFORD	THOMPSON,	MARY	ELAINE’S	AT	THE	PHOENICIAN	(SCOTTSDALE,	ARIZONA)

There	is	salt	in	almost	all	of	my	desserts.	However,	you	would	not	know	it	was	there	until	I
took	it	out	—	which	is	how	it	should	be.	You	don’t	need	to	taste	the	salt,	but	it	helps	open
the	palate	and	stimulates	your	taste	buds.	With	something	fatty	like	chocolate,	you	need
some	salt	to	brighten	it	up.	I	use	all	sorts	of	salts	with	my	desserts.	We	are	making	a
peanut	butter	and	jelly	bonbon	that	I	pair	with	smoked	Brittany	sea	salt.	Maldon	salt	is
shaved	and	more	about	texture,	because	it	is	not	as	strong;	I	would	use	it	on	a	pancake	or
something	creamy.	Fleur	de	sel	is	a	salt	with	texture	and	ocean	floral	notes,	and	would	go
well	on	our	panini	which	have	cheese,	arugula,	and	vinaigrette.
—	JOHNNY	IUZZINI,	JEAN	GEORGES	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Salt	goes	into	almost	every	dough	we	make	and	is	something	that	makes	flavors	pop.
Some	chefs	can	go	a	little	overboard,	but	desserts	should	still	be	sweet.	Salt	works	well
with	caramel	and	chocolate,	obviously.	I	also	use	a	vanilla	salt	with	a	classic	sweet
potato	tart	that	is	cut	into	four	slices	with	a	few	grains	on	each	slice.	The	salt	reinforces
the	savoriness	of	the	sweet	potato	and	plays	off	the	brightness	of	the	preserved	lemon	on
the	plate.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

To	counteract	oversalting	a	dish,	you	need	to	increase	the	volume	of	whatever	you	are
making.	That	can	be	tricky,	because	you	don’t	want	to	end	up	with	something	too	watery.
Whenever	there	is	a	puree	involved,	whether	it	is	mashed	potatoes	or	butternut	squash
soup,	I	encourage	my	cooks	to	make	it	thick.	You	can	always	add,	but	not	take	away.

SOUS-VIDE	COOKING

What	sous-vide	[“under	vacuum”]	cooking	does	is	give	you	a	long,	very	controlled	cooking	time.	I	like	to
use	it	on	vegetables	because	no	air	hits	the	vegetable.	All	the	white	vegetables	come	out	really	white.	It
also	keeps	the	whiteness	in	fruits	like	apples	and	pears.

VINEGAR	—	IN	GENERAL

I	use	a	variety	of	vinegars	and	right	now	I	am	using	cider	vinegar,	balsamic,	and	white	balsamic.	What
vinegar	you	grab	really	depends	on	how	far	you	can	push	the	product.	When	we	make	a	walnut	sauce,	it
can	handle	a	good-sized	dash	of	cider	vinegar.	In	a	fluke	tartare,	we’ll	only	use	a	drop	of	vinegar.

“We	don’t	accomplish	anything	in	this	world	alone	.	.	.	and	whatever	happens	is	the	result	of	the	whole
tapestry	of	one’s	life	and	all	the	weavings	of	individual	threads	from	one	to	another	that	creates
something.”
—	SANDRA	DAY	O’CONNOR

We’d	like	to	thank	some	of	the	many	people	whose	invaluable	threads	helped	to	create	the	tapestry	that	is
The	Flavor	Bible.

approach	flavor	development	and	innovation	—	and	whose	insights	in	this	book	will	surely	inspire	the
next	generation	to	new	heights	of	creativity	in	the	kitchen.

At	Little,	Brown,	thanks	to	our	editor,	Michael	L.	Sand,	whose	advice	and	counsel	we	are	both	lucky
and	grateful	to	have	had	leading	this	team.	He	was	not	only	a	trusted	sounding	board	for	editorial	issues,
but	his	great	taste	extends	from	his	keen	eye	overseeing	this	book’s	gorgeous	design	to	our	delectable

April	2008

P.S.	from	Andrew	Dornenburg:	The	Flavor	Bible	is	our	first	book	with	Karen’s	name	listed	first	on	the
cover,	even	though	she	has	always	been	the	prime	conceptualizer	and	writer	of	all	of	them.	Karen
generously	suggested	before	our	first	book	came	out	in	1995	that	we	list	our	names	alphabetically	—	a
tradition	that	continued	more	out	of	publishing	convenience	(having	all	our	books	alphabetized	together	on
bookstore	shelves,	for	example)	than	anything	else.	However,	she	is	long	overdue	to	be	properly	credited
as	the	primary	force	behind	our	work	together.	I	couldn’t	be	happier	about	the	change!

PREFACE

“When	we	no	longer	have	good	cooking	in	the	world,	we	will	have	no	literature,	nor	high	and	sharp
intelligence,	nor	friendly	gatherings,	nor	social	harmony.”

—	MARIE-ANTOINE	CARÊME,	CHEF	(1784–1833)

“Good	cooking	is	an	art,	as	well	as	a	form	of	intense	pleasure.	.	.	.	A	recipe	is	only	a	theme,	which	an
intelligent	cook	can	play	each	time	with	a	variation.”

—	MADAME	JEHANE	BENOÎT,	CHEF	(1904–1987)

“You	have	to	love	either	what	you	are	going	to	eat,	or	the	person	you	are	cooking	for.	Then	you	have	to
give	yourself	up	to	cooking.	Cuisine	is	an	act	of	love.”

—	ALAIN	CHAPEL,	CHEF	(1937–1990)

The	first	quotation	suggests	why	we	do	what	we	do,	while	the	others	suggest	how.	We	published	our	first
book	in	1995,	and	it	is	exciting	as	we	approach	the	publication	of	The	Flavor	Bible	in	2008	to	witness
the	realm	of	good	cooking	as	it	reaches	a	new	“tipping	point.”

No	longer	content	simply	to	replicate	others’	recipes,	today’s	cooks	—	professionals	and	amateurs
alike	—	increasingly	seek	to	create	their	own	dishes.	In	doing	so,	they	celebrate	the	creative	process	of
cooking	as	much	as	the	finished	product.

Cooking	at	its	most	basic	level	is	a	creative	act,	one	of	transforming	food	through	the	application	of

heat	and	the	incorporation	of	other	ingredients.	But	there	are	different	orders	of	creativity,	and	merely
following	a	recipe	is	a	creative	act	of	the	most	basic	order,	like	painting	by	numbers.

When	accomplished	cooks	grow	restless,	they	start	to	analyze	instructions	before	following	them	to

see	if	they	can	improve	upon	the	results,	thus	raising	the	act	of	cooking	to	a	creative	act	of	a	higher	order.
As	their	experience	grows,	cooks	are	able	to	bring	greater	intuition	and	even	inspiration	to	their	cooking.
Traditional	cookbooks	are	aimed	at	first-order	cooks.	Every	cook	owes	a	debt	of	gratitude	to	those
who	have	brought	progress	to	cuisine	throughout	history	—	those	who	famously	codified	classic	cuisines
through	the	painstaking	chronicling	of	recipes,	from	Auguste	Escoffier	in	France	to	others	around	the
globe.	Appreciation	is	also	due	to	those	who	have	elevated	and	expanded	the	range	of	available
ingredients	and	techniques,	the	essential	building	blocks	of	cooking.

Over	the	years,	cookbooks	have	come	to	dictate	precise	measurement	of	ingredients	along	with
instructions	for	their	preparation	and	assembly,	which	has	done	much	to	improve	the	general	accessibility
of	recipes.	However,	they	also	have	come	to	provide	a	false	sense	of	security	for	which	the	unsuspecting
cook	pays	a	price.	When	a	recipe	is	rigidly	scripted	and	blindly	followed,	it	negates	the	cook’s	own


creative	instincts	and	good	judgment	—	not	to	mention	much	of	the	pleasure	of	truly	“being”	in	the
moment.

“Great	cooks	rarely	bother	to	consult	cookbooks.”

—	CHARLES	SIMIC,	U.S.	POET	LAUREATE

Those	with	the	urge	to	innovate	had	long	been	on	their	own	in	the	kitchen	until	many	adopted	our	1996
book,	Culinary	Artistry,	as	their	muse.	That	book	sought	to	break	the	mold	of	contemporary	prescriptive
cookbooks	and	to	restore	the	creative	instinct	to	chefs.	Drawing	on	classic	flavor	combinations	and
preparations,	it	put	the	wisdom	of	history	at	cooks’	fingertips	for	the	first	time	—	and	with	the	same	ease
with	which	writers	consulted	a	thesaurus.

As	time	passed,	it	became	clear	that	chefs	were	thinking	of	flavors	and	their	combination	in	new
ways,	beyond	the	classics	chronicled	in	Culinary	Artistry.	Meanwhile,	the	gap	between	professionals	and
amateur	cooks	narrowed,	as	the	latter	installed	Viking	ranges	at	home	to	prepare	a	burgeoning	array	of
new	ingredients,	with	their	TVs	transformed	into	virtual	twenty-four-hour	cooking	schools,	given	the
advent	of	culinary	programming.

“Food	without	wine	is	a	corpse;	wine	without	food	is	a	ghost.	United	and	well	matched,	they	are	as
body	and	soul:	living	partners.”

—	ANDRÉ	SIMON,	CHEF	(1877–1970)

Since	the	year	2000	we	have	been	studying	the	new	ways	in	which	flavors	are	being	combined.	It	has
been	a	privilege	to	interview	many	of	the	country’s	most	imaginative	chefs	and	other	food	and	drink
experts	(turning	to	an	entirely	different	lineup	from	those	we	spoke	to	for	Culinary	Artistry).	Some	are
well-established	industry	pioneers,	while	others	have	risen	on	the	scene	in	recent	years.	All	have	wowed
us	with	their	savory	cuisines	and/or	desserts,	and	often	in	spots	less	traveled,	from	Dallas	to	New
Orleans	to	Hoboken.	We’ve	also	combed	the	most	recent	culinary	literature	published	in	2000	or	later.
The	first	result	was	our	2006	book,	What	to	Drink	with	What	You	Eat,	which	celebrated	the
harmonious	combination	of	food	and	drink	and,	indeed,	their	inseparability,	as	suggested	by	the	André
Simon	quotation.

The	second	result	is	The	Flavor	Bible,	which,	like	Culinary	Artistry,	is	not	intended	to	be

prescriptive;	rather,	it	is	an	empowerment	tool.	The	Flavor	Bible	is	a	comprehensive,	easy-to-use	single-
volume	reference	of	more	than	six	hundred	alphabetical	entries	listing	modern-day	compatible	flavors,
chronicling	new	flavor	synergies	in	the	new	millennium.

Our	books	Culinary	Artistry	(classic	flavor	combinations	before	1996),	The	Flavor	Bible	(modern

flavor	combinations	since	2000),	and	What	to	Drink	with	What	You	Eat	(classic	and	modern	food	and
drink	combinations)	are	essential	to	use	in	concert,	as	each	covers	different	aspects	of	food	and	drink
flavor	harmony.

We	believe	cooking	will	continue	to	evolve,	and	not	only	as	a	means	of	“doing”	(i.e.,	putting	dinner	on	the
table,	or	“problem-solving”	by	“following	a	recipe”).	Over	time,	we	believe	more	people	—	including,
perhaps,	yourself	—	will	have	discovered	it	as	a	way	of	“being”	in	the	world.	We	have	learned	enough
over	the	past	decade	or	two	to	question	why	cooking	is	done	one	way	versus	another.	This	thoughtful
sensory	engagement	leads	to	a	store	of	experiences	that	allow	us	to	bring	more	intuition	to	the	cooking
process,	synthesizing	what	we’ve	done	before	into	innovative	approaches	to	creating	a	dish.	Ultimately,
cooking	offers	the	opportunity	to	be	immersed	in	one’s	senses	and	in	the	moment	like	no	other	activity,
uniting	the	inner	and	outer	selves.	At	these	times,	cooking	transcends	drudgery	and	becomes	a	means	of
meditation	and	even	healing.

It	is	little	surprise	to	us,	then,	that	when	U.S.	Poet	Laureate	Charles	Simic	was	asked	by	the	New	York

Times	Magazine’s	Deborah	Solomon	earlier	this	year,	“What	advice	would	you	give	to	people	who	are
looking	to	be	happy?”	his	response	was	“For	starters,	learn	how	to	cook.”

We	hope	this	book	makes	you	happy	—	literally.

FLAVOR	=	TASTE	+	MOUTHFEEL	+	AROMA	+	“THE	X
FACTOR”:	LEARNING	TO	RECOGNIZE	THE	LANGUAGE	OF
FOOD

Magical	dishes,	magical	words:	A	great	cook	is,	when	all	is	said	and	done,	a	great	poet.	.	.	.	For	was	it
not	a	visit	from	the	Muses	that	inspired	the	person	who	first	had	the	idea	of	marrying	rice	and	chicken,
grape	and	thrush,	potatoes	and	entrecôte,	Parmesan	and	pasta,	eggplant	and	tomato,	Chambertin	and
cockerel,	liqueur	brandy	and	woodcock,	onion	and	tripe?


—	MARCEL	E.	GRANCHER,	CINQUANTE	ANS	À	TABLE	(1953)

FLAVOR	=	TASTE	+	MOUTHFEEL	+	AROMA	+	“THE	X
FACTOR”

Taste	=	What	is	perceived	by	the	taste	buds
Mouthfeel	=	What	is	perceived	by	the	rest	of	the	mouth
Aroma	=	What	is	perceived	by	the	nose
“The	X	Factor”	=	What	is	perceived	by	the	other	senses	—	plus	the	heart,	mind,	and	spirit

Our	taste	buds	can	perceive	only	four	basic	tastes:	sweet,	salty,	sour,	and	bitter.	The	essence	of	great
cooking	is	to	bring	these	four	tastes	into	balanced	harmony	to	create	deliciousness.	It’s	that	simple	—	and
that	difficult.	After	all,	flavor	is	a	function	not	only	of	taste,	but	also	of	smell,	touch,	sight,	and	sound.
Because	we’re	human	beings,	other	nonphysical	factors	come	into	play,	including	our	emotions,	thoughts,
and	spirits.

Learning	to	recognize	as	well	as	manipulate	both	the	obvious	and	subtle	components	of	flavor	will

make	you	a	much	better	cook.	This	book	will	be	your	companion	in	the	kitchen	whenever	you	wish	to
create	deliciousness.

Learning	to	cook	like	a	great	chef	is	within	the	realm	of	possibility.	However,	it	is	something	that	is

rarely	taught;	it	must	be	“caught.”

Everyone	who	cooks	—	or	even	merely	seasons	their	food	at	the	table	before	eating	—	can	benefit
from	mastering	the	basic	principles	of	making	food	taste	great.	This	complex	subject	is	simplified	by	one
thing:	while	the	universe	may	contain	a	vast	number	of	ingredients	and	a	virtually	infinite	number	of
ingredient	combinations,	the	palate	can	register	only	the	four	basic	tastes.

Great	food	balances	these	tastes	beautifully.	A	great	cook	knows	how	to	taste,	to	discern	what	is
needed,	and	to	make	adjustments.	Once	you	learn	how	to	season	and	how	to	balance	tastes,	a	whole	new
world	opens	up	to	you	in	cooking.	Of	course,	several	factors	conspire	against	your	ever	doing	so	—	not
the	least	of	which	is	a	culture	that	sees	the	publication	of	thousands	of	new	cookbooks	annually	featuring
recipes	that	promise	to	dazzle	you	and	your	guests	if	you	follow	them	to	the	letter.	And	yet	you’re	often
left	wondering	why	the	results	aren’t	as	delicious	as	promised.	That’s	because	great	cooking	is	never	as
simple	as	merely	following	a	recipe.	The	best	cooking	requires	a	discerning	palate	to	know	when	a	dish
needs	a	little	something	or	other	—	and	what	to	add	or	do	to	elevate	its	flavor.

WHAT	IS	PERCEIVED	BY	THE	MOUTH

Sweetness.	Saltiness.	Sourness.	Bitterness.	Every	delicious	bite	you’ve	ever	tasted	has	been	a	result	of
these	four	tastes	coming	together	on	your	taste	buds.	We	taste	them	as	individual	notes,	and	in	concert.
Each	taste	affects	the	other.	For	example,	bitterness	suppresses	sweetness.	In	addition,	different	tastes
affect	us	in	different	ways.	Saltiness	stimulates	the	appetite,	while	sweetness	satiates	it.	Take	the	time	to
explore	the	four	basic	tastes.

Taste	Buds

Sweetness


Saltiness

Sourness

Bitterness

Mouthfeel

Temperature

It	takes	the	greatest	quantity	of	a	substance	that	is	sweet	(versus	salty,	sour,	or	bitter)	to	register	on	our
taste	buds.	However,	we	can	appreciate	the	balance	and	“roundness”	that	even	otherwise	imperceptible
sweetness	adds	to	savory	dishes.	Sweetness	can	work	with	bitterness,	sourness	—	even	saltiness.
Sweetness	can	also	bring	out	the	flavors	of	other	ingredients,	from	fruits	to	mint.

When	we	banished	more	than	thirty	of	America’s	leading	chefs	to	their	own	desert	islands	with	only	ten
ingredients	to	cook	with	for	the	rest	of	their	lives	(Culinary	Artistry,	1996),	the	number-one	ingredient
they	chose	was	salt.	Salt	is	nature’s	flavor	enhancer.	It	is	the	single	most	important	taste	for	making	savory
food	delicious.	(Sweetness,	by	the	way,	plays	the	same	role	in	desserts.)

Sourness	is	second	only	to	salt	in	savory	food	and	sugar	in	sweet	food	in	its	importance	as	a	flavor
enhancer.	Sour	notes	—	whether	a	squeeze	of	lemon	or	a	drizzle	of	vinegar	—	add	sparkle	and	brightness
to	a	dish.	Balancing	a	dish’s	acidity	with	its	other	tastes	is	critical	to	the	dish’s	ultimate	success.

Humans	are	most	sensitive	to	bitterness,	and	our	survival	wiring	allows	us	to	recognize	it	in	even
relatively	tiny	amounts.	Bitterness	balances	sweetness,	and	can	also	play	a	vital	role	in	cutting	richness	in
a	dish.	While	bitterness	is	more	important	to	certain	people	than	to	others,	some	chefs	see	it	as	an
indispensable	“cleansing”	taste	—	one	that	makes	you	want	to	take	the	next	bite,	and	the	next.

Umami	(Savoriness)

In	addition	to	the	four	basic	tastes,	there	is	growing	evidence	of	a	fifth	taste,	umami,	which	we	first	wrote
about	in	1996	in	Culinary	Artistry.	It	is	often	described	as	the	savory	or	meaty	“mouth-filling”	taste	that
is	noticeable	in	such	ingredients	as	anchovies,	blue	cheese,	mushrooms,	and	green	tea,	and	in	such
flavorings	as	monosodium	glutamate	(MSG),	which	is	the	primary	component	of	branded	seasonings	such
as	Ac´cent.

In	addition	to	its	sense	of	taste,	the	mouth	has	a	sense	of	“touch”	and	can	register	other	sensations,	such	as
temperature	and	texture,	that	all	play	a	role	in	flavor.	These	aspects	of	food,	generally	characterized	as
mouthfeel,	help	to	bring	food	into	alignment	with	our	bodies,	and	bring	some	of	a	dish’s	greatest	interest
and	pleasure.	The	crunchiness	and	crispiness	of	a	dish	contribute	sound	as	well	as	textural	appeal.

I	always	pay	attention	to	temperature.	I	look	at	what	I	feel	like	eating	now.	If	it	is	cold	and	rainy
outside,	I	make	sure	that	soup	is	on	the	menu.	If	it	is	hot	outside,	I	make	sure	there	are	lots	ofsalads	on
the	menu.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Temperature	is	one	of	the	foremost	among	the	other	sensations	that	can	be	perceived	by	the	mouth.	The
temperature	of	our	food	even	affects	our	perception	of	its	taste;	for	example,	coldness	suppresses


sweetness.	Boston	pastry	chef	Rick	Katz,	with	whom	Andrew	cooked	at	Lydia	Shire’s	restaurant	Biba,
first	taught	him	the	lesson	of	pulling	out	the	ice	cream	a	few	minutes	before	serving	so	that	the	slight	rise
in	temperature	could	maximize	its	flavor.

A	food’s	temperature	can	affect	both	the	perception	and	enjoyment	of	a	dish.	A	chilled	carrot	soup	on

a	hot	summer	day	—	and	hot	roasted	carrots	on	a	cold	winter	day	—	could	be	said	to	be	“healing”
through	their	ability	to	bring	our	bodies	into	greater	alignment	with	our	environment.

Texture

I	would	never	serve	pike	on	a	base	of	chowder,	because	balance	and	texture	are	so	important	when	it
comes	to	creating	a	dish.	Is	there	a	rich	component,	a	lean	component,	a	crunchy	component,	and	a
cleansing	component?	Are	all	the	taste	sensors	activated	so	that	you	want	to	go	back	for	a	second
bite?	Cod	works	better	over	a	richer	preparation	like	chowder.	I	would	also	make	sure	to	choose	the
right	technique	for	the	cod:	I	would	not	poach	it,	because	if	it	is	poached	it	would	be	silky	on	silky.	If
it	is	seared,	it	is	crunchy	on	silky	—	which	is	more	appealing	because	of	the	contrast.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

A	food’s	texture	is	central	to	its	ability	to	captivate	and	to	please.	We	value	pureed	and/or	creamy	foods
(such	as	soups	and	mashed	potatoes)	as	“comfort”	foods,	and	crunchiness	and	crispiness	(such	as	nachos
and	caramel	corn)	as	“fun”	foods.	We	enjoy	texture	as	it	activates	our	other	senses,	including	touch,	sight,
and	sound.

While	babies	by	necessity	eat	pureed	foods,	most	adults	enjoy	a	variety	of	textures,	particularly
crispiness	and	crunchiness,	which	break	up	the	smoothness	of	texture	—	or	even	the	simple	monotony	—
of	dishes.

Piquancy

Astringency

Our	mouths	can	also	sense	what	we	often	incorrectly	refer	to	as	“hotness,”	meaning	piquancy’s
“sharpness”	and/or	“spiciness”	—	whether	boldly	as	in	chile	peppers,	or	more	subtly	as	in	a	sprinkle	of
cayenne	pepper.	Some	people	find	the	experience	of	these	picante	(as	the	Spanish	refer	to	it,	or	piccante
as	the	Italians	do)	tastes	more	pleasurable	than	others.


Our	mouths	“pucker”	to	register	astringency.	This	is	a	drying	sensation	caused	by	the	tannins	in	red	wine
or	strong	tea,	and	occasionally	in	foods	such	as	walnuts,	cranberries,	and	unripe	persimmons.

WHAT	IS	PERCEIVED	BY	THE	NOSE

Aroma

Pungency

Chemesthesis

Aroma	is	thought	to	be	responsible	for	as	much	as	80	percent	or	more	of	flavor.	This	helps	to	explain	the
popularity	of	aromatic	ingredients,	from	fresh	herbs	and	spices	to	grated	lemon	zest.	Incorporating
aromatic	ingredients	can	enhance	the	aroma	of	your	dish	and,	in	turn,	its	flavor.

Some	qualities	are	perceived	through	both	the	sense	of	taste	and	smell,	such	as:

Pungency	refers	to	the	taste	and	aroma	of	such	ingredients	as	horseradish	and	mustard	that	are	as	irritating
—	albeit	often	pleasantly	—	to	the	nose	as	they	are	to	the	palate.

Chemesthesis	refers	to	other	sensations	that	tickle	(e.g.,	the	tingle	of	carbonated	beverages)	or	play	tricks
on	(e.g.,	the	false	perception	of	“heat”	from	chile	peppers,	or	“cold”	from	peppermint)	our	gustatory
senses.

Sweets

We	believe	that	food	preparation	is	60	percent	ingredients	and	40	percent	technique.

—	DOMINIQUE	AND	CINDY	DUBY,	WILD	SWEETS	(VANCOUVER)

Flavor	is	the	combination	of	the	taste	you	experience	on	your	tongue	and	the	aroma	you
experience	through	your	nose.	We	believe	that	as	much	as	90	percent	of	what	we	perceive
as	taste	is	actually	aroma.	When	you	eat	a	pineapple,	the	flavor	really	comes	through	the
nose.	So,	if	your	pineapple	is	not	ripe,	it	won’t	have	much	aroma.	It	may	taste	sweet,	but	it
won’t	taste	like	pineapple.

There	are	two	ways	to	bring	flavor	to	a	dish,	through	aroma	or	through	chemical
reaction.	We	always	say	that	cooking	is	no	different	from	doing	a	lab	experiment:	The
minute	you	add	heat	to	a	raw	product,	you	are	changing	the	status	of	that	product.	When
you	use	the	Maillard	reaction	—	which	is	what	happens	when	you	sear	a	piece	of	meat	—
you	are	getting	a	reaction	of	caramelization	from	the	carbohydrates	and	amino	acids.	This
chemical	reaction	creates	flavor.

To	add	aroma	to	a	dish,	think	of	a	piece	of	fish	cooked	in	broth	with	herbs	or	lemon.
The	problem	is	that	the	flavor	escapes	into	the	air.	If	you	walk	into	a	room	and	it	smells
great,	that	means	there	is	not	much	flavor	left	in	the	dish.	The	aroma	has	escaped.	So,	if
you	want	to	add	aroma	to	a	dish,	the	best	way	is	through	sous-vide	cooking	[which	cooks


encased	food	at	long,	slow	temperatures].	This	method	traps	the	aroma	into	what	you	are
cooking	without	letting	it	escape.

The	problem	is	that	sous	vide	is	not	available	for	home	cooks.	What	a	home	cook	can
do	is	“sealed	cooking,”	where	you	take	a	heavy-duty	freezer	zip	lock	bag,	put	in	what	you
want	to	cook	with	the	liquid,	then	cook	it	over	a	steady	heat	on	your	stove.	Another	method
that	works	is	putting	the	bag	in	a	pot	with	a	single-cup	water	heater	that	goes	to	about	140
degrees	Fahrenheit	and,	from	time	to	time,	stirring	the	water.	[Note:	Care	must	be	taken
with	this	low-temperature	method	of	cooking	to	avoid	food	poisoning.]

This	is	a	way	to	put	—	and	keep	—	a	lot	of	flavor	in	whatever	you	are	cooking.

WHAT	IS	PERCEIVED	BY	THE	HEART,	MIND,	AND	SPIRIT

“The	X	Factor”

When	we	are	present	to	what	we	are	eating,	food	has	the	power	to	affect	our	entire	selves.	We	experience
food	not	only	through	our	five	physical	senses	—	including	our	sense	of	sight,	which	we	address	first
below	—	but	also	emotionally,	mentally,	and	even	spiritually.

Compatible	Flavors
An	essential	aspect	of	great	cooking	is	harnessing	compatible	flavors	—	which	involves
knowing	which	herbs,	spices,	and	other	flavorings	best	accentuate	particular	ingredients.

A	process	of	trial	and	error	over	centuries	resulted	in	classic	cuisines	and	dishes,	some
of	which	feature	timeless	combinations	of	beloved	flavor	pairings	—	for	example,	basil	with
tomatoes,	rosemary	with	lamb,	and	tarragon	with	lobster.

However,	today	it’s	possible	to	use	scientific	techniques	to	analyze	similar	molecular
structures	to	come	up	with	new,	compatible	pairing	possibilities,	as	odd	as	some	might
sound	—	such	as	jasmine	with	pork	liver,	parsley	with	banana,	or	white	chocolate	with
caviar.

The	Visual

The	visual	presentation	of	a	dish	can	greatly	enhance	the	pleasure	we	derive	from	it.	Just	a	few	decades
ago,	it	was	still	possible	to	taste	a	dish	with	the	eyes,	but	only	those	who’d	spent	time	in	world-class
kitchens	knew	the	tricks	of	such	artistic	plate	presentation.	Since	the	advent	of	Art	Culinaire	and	the	Web,


it’s	become	easier	to	reproduce	a	great	dish’s	elaborate	form	than	its	exquisite	flavor.

How	a	dish	looks	can	also	affect	our	perception	of	its	flavor	in	more	direct	ways;	for	example,	the

deeper	the	color	of	a	berry	sorbet,	the	more	berry	flavor	is	perceived.	The	stronger	the	connection
between	a	particular	food	and	a	particular	color,	the	stronger	the	flavor	impact	—	such	as	berries	with
red,	lemon	with	yellow,	and	lime	with	green.

The	Emotional

I	say	all	the	time	that	[my	mother’s	Spanish	potato	and	egg	tortilla]	is	my	favorite	because	it	conveys
a	point:	that	sentimental	value	comes	above	all	else.
—	FERRAN	ADRIA,	EL	BULLI	(SPAIN)

We	taste	with	our	hearts	as	much	as	with	our	tongues.	What	else	could	explain	adult	preferences	for	one’s
mother’s	dishes	over	those	prepared	by	a	great	chef?	This	also	helps	to	explain	the	lasting	appeal	of
traditional	dishes	and	cuisines	of	countries	around	the	globe,	which	stem	from	our	love	for	their	cultures,
their	people,	and	the	deeply	rooted	culinary	traditions	that	have	sustained	them	over	centuries.

The	Mental

The	Spiritual

If	we	ate	only	for	sustenance,	we	could	probably	survive	on	nutritive	pills	and	water.	But	we	also	eat	for
pleasure.	Because	we	typically	eat	three	times	a	day,	365	days	a	year,	we	enjoy	novelty,	such	as	a	twist
on	the	traditional	construct	of	a	dish.	Increasingly,	since	the	1980s	and	the	advent	of	“tall”	food,	chefs
have	played	with	the	presentation	of	their	ingredients.	Since	the	1990s,	the	advent	of	avant-garde	cuisine
and	so-called	molecular	gastronomy	has	seen	chefs	experiment	more	and	more	with	both	the	chemical
composition	and	presentation	of	dishes	as	well.

The	preparation,	cooking,	and	eating	of	food	is	a	sacrament.	Treating	it	as	such	has	the	potential	to	elevate
the	quality	of	our	daily	lives	like	nothing	else.	Several	of	the	world’s	leading	chefs	have	worked	to
perfect	each	aspect	of	the	dining	encounter	—	from	the	food	and	drink	to	the	ambiance	to	the	service	—	to
raise	the	overall	experience	to	a	new	level	imbued	not	only	with	pleasure,	comfort,	and	interest,	but	also
with	meaning.

Choosing	a	Cooking	Technique	with	Michael	Anthony	of
Gramercy	Tavern	in	New	York	City
When	we	look	at	an	ingredient,	we	ask,	“How	can	we	maximize	the	inherent	flavor	or	quality
of	what	this	is?”	As	in	any	other	progressive	modern	kitchen,	there	is	a	fascination	with


examining	all	the	new	techniques	we	can	get	our	hands	on.	We	have	used	sous	vide	[i.e.,
cooking	vacuum-packed	ingredients	at	low	temperatures	for	long	periods	of	time],	but	we
are	far	from	letting	any	technique	drive	a	dish.

Alice	Waters	described	something	cooked	via	sous	vide	as	“dead”	food.	I	can

understand	her	opinion	because	she	is	all	about	inflecting	that	“fresh-cut	crunch”	feeling	into
her	food.	Sous	vide	is	all	about	a	long,	slow	cooking	process	—	and	those	products	calling
for	that	[such	as	tougher	cuts	of	meat]	will	be	awesome.

Why	we	choose	any	specialized	piece	of	equipment	for	a	dish	always	gets	back	to

good	old-fashioned	cooking	principles:	What	is	the	best	way	of	capturing	flavors?

That	is	how	choosing	a	technique	fits	into	my	cooking.
I’m	excited	to	eat	in	restaurants	that	are	pushing	the	boundaries	of	presentation	and

technique.	Yet	my	personal	take	on	food	that	is	too	technically	driven	is	that	technique
comes	first	and	taste	comes	second.	I	feel	the	meals	that	hit	home	are	ones	where	the
flavor	is	there	and	you	are	eating	a	meal	in	a	distinct	time	and	place.	I	love	it	when	people
look	back	on	a	meal,	and	the	time	of	year	is	what	made	it	special.	The	ingredients	they
tasted	seemed	naturally	a	part	of	that	moment	because	that	is	what	is	available	then.

Sometimes	straightforward	flavors	are	the	ones	people	can	latch	on	to,	even	though	the

ingredients	can	be	very	sophisticated	behind	the	scenes.	If,	ultimately,	the	flavor
combination	is	one	that	is	simple	and	straightforward,	with	an	impressive	balance	of	acidity
and	bitterness,	and	you	remember	it,	then	you	win	as	a	diner.	Sometimes	the	meals	that	hit
home	are	not	the	ones	that	were	the	most	complicated.

FLAVOR	FROM	THE	INSIDE	OUT

America’s	foremost	chefs	reached	the	pinnacle	of	their	profession	through	their	painstaking	attention	to
every	aspect	of	their	cuisine	and	the	restaurant	experience.	Chefs	bring	their	own	unique	approaches	to
their	cuisines,	which	are	arguably	rooted	in	either	the	physical,	emotional,	mental,	or	spiritual	—	although
they	can	span	two,	three,	or	even	all	of	them.

Chefs	whose	focus	celebrates	the	physical	realm	include	Alice	Waters	of	Chez	Panisse	in	Berkeley,
California,	with	her	pathbreaking	focus	on	the	quality	of	ingredients	sourced	and	served,	and	Dan	Barber
of	Blue	Hill	at	Stone	Barns	in	Pocantico	Hills,	New	York,	whose	on-premises	greenhouse,	gardens,	and
pastures	grow	and	raise	much	of	what	the	restaurant	serves.

Celebrating	the	emotional	realm	are	those	chefs	whose	cuisines	are	closely	tied	to	a	specific	culture,

its	people,	and	their	traditions.	It	includes	chefs	such	as	Rick	Bayless,	whose	Frontera	Grill	and
Topolobampo	in	Chicago	elevate	Mexican	cuisine,	and	Vikram	Vij	and	Meeru	Dhalwala,	whose	Vij’s
and	Rangoli	restaurants	in	Vancouver	honor	and	celebrate	the	cooking	of	India	and	tap	Indian	women
exclusively	to	staff	their	kitchens.

Easily	identifiable	as	part	of	the	mental	realm	are	chefs	whose	efforts	are	reconceptualizing	how
food	can	be	manipulated	and	presented,	such	as	Chicago’s	Grant	Achatz	of	Alinea	(with	signature	dishes
such	as	bacon	on	a	clothesline)	and	Homaro	Cantu	of	Moto	(whose	dishes	include	incorporating	edible
paper	printed	with	soy-based	inks,	and	a	doughnut	soup	that	looks	like	eggnog	and	tastes	just	like	a
doughnut).

Through	the	elevation	not	only	of	their	cuisines	but	of	the	creation	and	orchestration	of	ambiance	and

service	as	well,	chefs	such	as	Daniel	Boulud	of	New	York’s	Restaurant	Daniel	and	Patrick	O’Connell	of


The	Inn	at	Little	Washington	in	Virginia	transcend	the	prior	three	categories	to	bring	the	dining	experience
to	another	level	in	the	spiritual	realm.

In	the	pages	that	follow,	we’ll	share	chefs’	reflections	on	working	in	the	first	three	realms.	(As	for

their	thoughts	on	the	fourth,	we	invite	you	to	visit	or	revisit	our	book	Culinary	Artistry.)

The	Physical	Realm

My	motto	has	always	been:	Find	the	best	ingredients	possible,	and	listen	to	what	they	tell	you	about
how	they	want	to	be	prepared.	Mess	with	them	as	little	as	you	can.	Keep	their	integrity,	but	at	the	same
time,	focus	their	flavor,	which	is	where	creativity	comes	in.
—	VITALY	PALEY,	PALEY’S	PLACE	(PORTLAND,	OREGON)

The	best	chefs	work	with	the	best	ingredients	available	to	them.	The	very	best	chefs	don’t	settle	for	this,
and	seek	out	even	better	ingredients	through	working	with	foragers,	developing	relationships	with	farmers
and	other	purveyors,	and	even	growing	their	own	produce	and	raising	their	own	animals.

Monica	Pope	of	T’afia	in	Houston

My	cooking	changed	radically	when	we	started	hosting	a	farmers’	market	[located	at	T’afia].	I	remember
when	I	was	cooking	in	California,	and	chefs	would	be	waiting	for	an	ingredient	to	come	into	season.
When	it	arrived,	their	philosophy	would	be	“Let’s	just	slice	it	and	not	screw	it	up.”	I	thought,	“That	is	just
not	the	way	restaurants	work.”	It’s	hard	to	believe	that	now	I	am	saying	the	same	thing	that	they	used	to
say.

Since	the	advent	of	the	farmers’	market,	when	I	get	a	product,	it	is	phenomenal	—	because	it	was
picked	at	the	right	time	and	has	never	even	been	refrigerated	before	it	comes	to	my	door.	Sometimes	I	feel
guilty	because	people	will	love	something,	and	ask	what	I	did	to	it.	Often	the	answer	is	“Very	little.”

Our	zucchini	salad	is	a	perfect	example	of	celebrating	what	comes	to	our	door.	We	get	baby	zucchini

and	we	shave	them	raw.	Then	we	add	a	flavored	pecan	oil,	raw	local	pecan	halves,	shaved	pecorino
cheese,	Mexican	marigold,	and	a	pinch	of	salt.

We	also	think	a	lot	about	the	best	way	to	present	these	ingredients.	The	salad	has	to	be	interesting	the

whole	way	through,	and	I	want	the	customer	to	have	the	experience	of	interacting	with	it	themselves.	I
want	them	to	have	the	experience	of	lifting	a	shaved	piece	of	cheese	after	their	bite	of	crunchy	yellow	or
light-green	squash.	They	will	see	that	the	salad	is	dressed	with	oil,	but	then	have	to	search	and	realize	that
it	is	pecan	oil.	Then	they	will	take	the	next	bite	and	get	the	herb	that	has	a	minty	note	to	it.	To	achieve	this,
I	will	taste	a	dish	night	after	night	to	make	sure	it	is	“eating”	the	way	I	want	it	to	eat.

Michael	Anthony	of	Gramercy	Tavern	in	New	York	City

You	want	to	have	an	infatuation	with	the	ingredients	you	cook	with.	You	want	to	tap	all	the	hopes	and
dreams	that	went	into	producing	that	ingredient.	You	need	to	think,	“Is	this	ingredient	not	only	up	to	par,
but	is	it	brilliant?”	When	it	is	cooked,	you	want	whoever	bites	into	what	you	made	to	think	that	the	flavor
is	bright,	interesting,	and	delicious.

I	take	a	simple	approach	to	my	food,	but	simple	food	does	not	mean	unmanipulated	food.	Sometimes

simple	food	is	simply	boring.

When	I	cook,	I	am	looking	to	pull	myself	back	from	a	dish	rather	than	add	to	a	dish.	I	would	rather	a

dish	feel	too	simple	than	too	fussy.	So,	sticking	to	my	core	principles,	I	never	want	to	overload	a	dish
with	too	many	ingredients.	But	cooking	is	not	always	one-two-three.	Sometimes	you	need	some	extra


ingredients	as	long	as	they	work	dynamically.

Dan	Barber	of	Blue	Hill	at	Stone	Barns	in	Pocantico	Hills,	New	York

Our	pork	dish	starts	not	at	the	table	with	the	cut	of	pork	on	the	plate,	but	in	the	field	with	what	kind	of
pork	we	choose	to	raise	for	our	restaurant.	I	make	a	lot	of	decisions	to	get	the	most	“pigness”	out	ofour
pork	dish.	We	raise	Berkshire	pigs,	which	have	a	great	flavor.	They	are	an	older	breed	that	has	a	flavor
profile	that	newer	breeds	don’t	have.	The	pig	has	a	great	intramuscular	profile	that	allows	it	to	develop	a
better	flavor.

We	feed	our	pigs	organic	grains	and	that	makes	a	huge	difference.	We	feed	them	a	wide	variety	of
grains	and	they	forage	as	well.	We	are	also	careful	of	how	much	corn	the	pigs	eat.	I	proved	unequivocally
this	summer	the	difference	feed	makes.	We	had	a	problem	getting	organic	grain	for	about	eight	weeks	and
had	to	use	conventional	grain	that	has	more	corn	in	it	because	it	is	cheap	to	use	in	the	feed.	I	tasted	our
pork	that	was	raised	exactly	the	same	way	side	by	side	with	the	only	change	being	the	feed,	and	the	flavor
was	as	different	as	night	and	day.	The	flavor	of	the	two	was	so	different	that	a	child	could	tell	them	apart.
We	also	make	sure	our	pigs	are	slaughtered	in	a	less	stressful	way.	This	makes	for	a	calmer	pig,	and

you	can	see	a	difference	in	the	meat	and	taste	the	difference	[in	the	texture]	on	the	plate.

At	Blue	Hill	when	you	order	the	pork	at	our	restaurant,	you	don’t	know	what	cut	you	will	be	getting.

We	serve	leg,	shoulder,	rack,	loin,	and	belly;	it	is	a	mix	on	the	plate.	This	makes	for	a	more	interesting


experience,	because	you	get	a	variety	of	flavors	and	textures.	We	keep	the	dish	pretty	straightforward.	We
will	serve	it	with	Brussels	sprout	leaves	and	chickpeas.

We	don’t	want	to	do	anything	to	hide	the	flavor.	We	make	a	pork	stock,	infuse	it	with	more	roasted
scraps	and	bones	to	make	a	pork	second	[also	known	as	a	remoulage],	then	do	one	more	pass	with	more
pork	and	very	little	wine.	This	is	water	that	has	been	infused	with	pork	three	times.

Depending	on	the	season,	I	will	make	an	infusion	with	herbs	like	a	tea	and	add	a	little	to	the	sauce	ifI

want	to	add	more	flavor.	The	reason	I	do	an	infusion	is	to	make	sure	the	flavor	is	so	light	that	you	don’t
even	know	it	is	there.

The	Emotional	Realm

I	have	no	professional	cooking	training.	My	starting	point	was,	What	do	I	know?	I	know	Indian	spices
and	flavors.
—	MEERU	DHALWALA,	VIJ’S	(VANCOUVER)

There	are	many	emotional	connections	to	draw	from	when	creating	dishes	—	from	the	bounty	of	a
particular	country	and	its	historic	evolution	into	a	national	cuisine,	to	the	classic	dishes	of	that	culture,
and	of	the	families	and	even	individual	cooks	within	it	—	as	each	might	bring	a	unique	twist	to	the
standards.

Maricel	Presilla	of	Cucharamama	and	Zafra	in	Hoboken,	New	Jersey

I’m	Cuban	—	but	whether	you	are	Cuban,	Venezuelan,	Chilean	[or	another	nationality],	there	is	an
enormous	pride	in	the	flavors	of	your	region	and	of	your	childhood.	It	is	like	mother’s	milk,	your	first
compass.	It	doesn’t	matter	how	much	you	travel	or	how	much	you	expand	your	palate:	You	always	come
back	to	this	notion	of	basic	flavors	and	ingredients,	time	and	again.

For	me,	being	a	Cuban	from	eastern	Cuba	is	my	anchor.	I	am	from	Santiago,	which	has	a	very	defined

cuisine.	It	is	more	influenced	by	the	neighboring	islands	such	as	Jamaica	and	Haiti,	which	both	have
European	influences	as	well.	The	cooks	from	those	islands	brought	flavors	with	them	like	allspice,	which
is	not	used	in	the	rest	of	Cuba.	My	family	uses	allspice	lavishly	in	our	adobo	and	in	other	dishes.	I	usit	a
lot	as	well	—	and	it	is	one	of	my	favorite	spices.	Our	cooking	has	more	complexity	than	the	food	of
Havana	because	of	these	influences.

We	have	the	most	interesting	cuisine	in	the	world	—	and	I	am	not	kidding.	I	have	traveled	throughout

South	America,	cooking	with	chefs	as	well	as	elderly	women,	not	to	mention	studying	the	history	of	our
cuisine	from	pre-Columbian	cooking	through	the	influence	of	Spanish	medieval	cooking.

What	is	fascinating	is	that	there	is	a	lot	of	structure	to	our	cooking	and	clearly	defined	rules	to	our

seasoning.

I	have	learned	how	all	these	flavors	work	in	their	nationalities	and	regions,	making	Latin	America	my

“backyard”	of	flavor.	I	am	like	a	painter,	and	every	painter	has	his	or	her	own	palette.	I	use	this	analogy
because	my	father	was	a	painter,	and	there	are	colors	that	he	would	never	use	that	would	not	be	on	his
palette.

When	I	want	to	be	creative,	I	am	comfortable	reaching	across	topographical	boundaries.	However,	I
do	so	with	an	understanding	of	all	the	basic	elements	of	flavor	in	South	American	cuisine	because	I	have
studied	them,	eaten	them,	and	lived	them!

Vikram	Vij	of	Vij’s	and	Rangoli	in	Vancouver


The	three	secrets	to	my	cooking?	Number	one,	my	wife,	Meeru.	Number	two,	treating	the	spices	with
integrity.	And	number	three,	using	local	produce	as	much	as	possible.

My	own	mother	is	from	the	northern	part	of	India,	so	my	style	and	flavors	are	a	combination	of
different	whole	and	ground	spices.	I	love	fenugreek	and	cinnamon	and	other	aromatics.	But	one	of	my
[signature	dishes]	is	actually	called	Mother-in-Law’s	Pork	Curry,	because	it	is	based	on	a	recipe	my
mother-in-law	gave	me	for	stewed	meat.

I	wanted	to	make	something	new	and	was	talking	to	Meeru,	who	told	me	her	mother	used	to	make	a
curry	with	lamb,	cream,	masala,	and	some	other	spices	and	that	they	loved	it.	I	decided	to	try	it	with	pork
instead	of	lamb.	It	was	vindaloo	style	with	vinegar,	and	green	onions	added	right	at	the	end	so	that	they
stayed	really	fresh.	There	were	too	many	spices	in	it	to	list	on	the	menu	so	it	just	made	sense	to	name	the
dish	after	her	instead.

When	I	opened	my	first	restaurant,	I	didn’t	have	a	liquor	license	and	did	not	want	to	serve	[soda]	pop

or	anything	with	artificial	ingredients	or	preservatives.	I	remembered	growing	up	in	India	and	having
lemon	water	with	a	hint	of	salt	and	pepper	as	a	homemade	lemonade.	[At	Vij’s,]	we	made	some	lemonade
and	added	a	little	ginger,	a	pinch	of	salt,	and	sparkling	water	to	give	the	refreshing	effervescence	of
[soda]	pop.	We	started	out	serving	it	with	pepper	as	well,	but	customers	couldn’t	get	used	to	seeing	black
pepper	in	a	drink.

It	is	wonderful	at	the	beginning	of	the	meal	to	refresh	your	palate.

Meeru	Dhalwala	Vij	of	Vij’s	and	Rangoli	in	Vancouver

While	working	in	India	for	eleven	months,	I	visited	Gujarat.	Having	been	raised	in	the	United	States,	to
me	“Indian	food”	was	what	my	mom	cooked.	I	had	no	idea	there	were	other	kinds!

If	you	watch	a	Bollywood	movie,	you	see	that	the	Punjabis	and	the	Gujaratis	make	a	lot	of	fun	of	each

other.	The	Gujaratis	find	us	Punjabis	very	volatile	and	show-offy.	They	will	say,	“Just	like	your	cuisine,
you	are	all	fiery	and	hot!”	We	Punjabis,	on	the	other	hand,	think	the	Gujaratis	are	quiet	and	dull.	Of
course,	for	me,	that	has	all	changed	—	I	love	all	Indians.

In	Gujarat,	at	the	end	of	cooking	a	curry,	they	would	add	a	teaspoon	of	sugar	and	a	half	a	lime.	The
first	time	I	tasted	this,	it	was	awful	—	but	then	I	found	out	that	the	cook	of	the	house	was	a	crappy	cook!
When	I	had	it	done	correctly,	it	was	delicious,	and	had	a	nice,	mellow	aftertaste.	So,	I	incorporated	lime
into	my	cooking	after	eating	Gujarati	food	in	India.

My	kitchen	is	staffed	by	Punjabi	women,	who	had	a	hard	time	using	lime	because	it	was	not	part	of

their	cooking	in	Punjab.	When	they	tasted	it,	they	thought,	“Yuck!	What’s	the	point?”	Since	my	Punjabi
cooks	don’t	like	lime,	this	led	me	to	start	using	kaffir	lime.	I	had	more	control	over	the	recipes’	flavor
because	I	could	just	say,	“Add	15	leaves	to	the	recipe.”	And	I	learned	that	turmeric	and	lime	leaf	are
wonderful	together,	by	the	way.

The	Mental	Realm

My	menu	may	read	as	unusual,	but	everything	is	really	just	a	slight	flip	on	a	traditional	flavor	profile.
If	I	pull	out	one	acid,	I	replace	it	with	another.	If	I	make	a	tagine	traditionally,	it	will	have	preserved
lemon.	Then	I’ll	ask,	“Would	it	work	with	lime	or	orange	juice?”	It	is	still	the	same	flavor	profile	in
that	it	will	still	have	a	cutting	acid	—	just	maybe	not	the	one	that	would	be	used	traditionally.

In	modern	architecture	and	design,	form	is	said	to	follow	function.	In	the	cutting-edge	world	of	avant-


garde	cuisine,	which	turns	classic	dishes	inside	out	for	the	sake	of	argument	or	even	simple	amusement,
form	follows	flavor.

Homaro	Cantu	of	Moto	in	Chicago

Moto	is	not	meant	to	be	an	everyday	experience.	Neither	is	Charlie	Trotter’s	[also	in	Chicago]	or	Daniel
[in	New	York	City].	Someone	could	say	that	these	chefs	are	just	cooking	for	themselves,	and	that	is	true	to
a	certain	extent.	I	am	doing	this	style	of	[avant-garde]	cooking	because	I	am	bored	with	other	dishes.	If	I
was	all	about	the	customer	and	just	wanted	to	make	people	happy,	I	would	cook	paella,	pizza,	and	burgers
all	day.	Everyone	would	have	smiles	on	their	faces!

There	is	a	little	bit	of	selfishness,	but	there	is	also	playfulness.	We	have	to	make	sure	guests	are
happy,	and	that	our	dishes	are	both	inventive	and	seasonal.	What	is	happening	[in	the	world]	right	now	is
that	we	are	expanding	our	repertoire	of	what	good	food	is.

At	Moto,	when	we	start	out	with	a	concept,	flavor	is	the	most	important	thing	but	also	the	last	thing

we	think	about.	Something	might	taste	great,	but	who	cares?	What	are	we	going	to	do	with	it?	As	it
pertains	to	us,	we	look	at	a	concept.	Then	it	evolves	into	something	where	we	tweak	the	flavor	a	little	bit
to	make	it	taste	more	like	it	“should.”	For	example,	once	we	wanted	to	make	a	cookie	with	a	really
concentrated	flavor.	So,	we	threw	cookies	into	the	dehydrator,	and	turned	them	into	powder.	This	created
a	new	building	block	for	flavor.	[Instead	of	the	flour	you	would	normally	use	in	your	dough,]	you	weigh
the	powdered	cookies	out	as	your	starch	in	your	normal	cookie	recipe.	But	this	starch	is	now	a	carrier	of
flavor	for	the	end	product	—	so	the	resulting	cookie	now	tastes	more	like	it	“should”	than	it	would	have
just	using	regular	flour.

A	lot	of	our	food	is	rooted	in	classic	combinations	—	and	it	has	to	be.	Why?	The	process	by	which
we	go	about	creating	is	so	foreign	that	we	have	to	make	something	that	you	are	familiar	with	eating.	In	a
tapas	restaurant,	you	have	had	generations	of	trial	and	error	to	create	a	dish	through	local	ingredients	and
techniques	that	have	evolved	into	something	that	tastes	good.	For	example,	olives	marinated	with	garlic
and	parsley	has	been	around	for	a	hundred	years.	Now,	there	is	nothing	wrong	with	that.	But,	for	us,	the
idea	of	marinating	olives	with	garlic	and	parsley	is	not	fun.	So,	we	are	going	to	make	a	dish	where	the
olives	are	actually	the	parsley	and	the	garlic	is	the	olives	and	so	on.	But	it	tastes	like	something	you’d
want.

What’s	in	a	Pancake?	Yes,	we	do	serve	real	food.	We	got	some	BLiS	syrup	[handcrafted	aged	maple
syrup]	in	the	kitchen	which	is	used	by	other	top	chefs	around	the	country.	This	stuff	is	liquid	gold!	This
syrup	is	aged	in	small	bourbon	barrels	in	Canada	and	is	$20	for	a	small	[375	ml]	bottle.	The	maker	even


hand-stamps	each	bottle	with	wax	and	writes	the	label	by	hand.	When	we	got	it	in,	we	knew	we	had	to	do
something	with	it.

We	decided	to	make	a	pancake	dish.	We	started	with	the	question	“How	can	we	make	this	dish	taste
more	like	pancakes	than	pancakes?”	So,	we	pureed	cooked	pancakes,	then	adjusted	the	liquid	with	milk.
The	cool	thing	about	making	a	pancake	puree	out	of	cooked	pancakes	is	that	you	can	alter	the
concentration	levels.	You	can’t	alter	the	concentration	levels	when	you	are	making	straight	pancakes.

We	wanted	to	trick	the	customer	into	thinking	that	they	were	going	to	eat	a	hot	pancake	topped	with
this	syrup.	Believability	is	so	important	in	the	process,	so	we	even	execute	the	dish	in	front	of	them	[in	the
dining	room].	We	bring	out	a	metal	plate	that	looks	hot	[but	is	frozen	and	steaming	from	being	immersed	in
nitrogen].	The	pancake	batter	is	then	shot	from	a	syringe.	The	batter	freezes	when	it	hits	the	metal.	When
we	serve	it,	we	top	it	with	the	BLiS	syrup.	Ninety-nine	percent	of	the	people	who	were	served	this	dish
swore	they	were	getting	a	hot	flapjack,	and	it	was	only	when	they	tasted	it	that	they	learned	it	was	cold.

Contrarian	by	Nature	People	want	to	say	that	wine	is	natural	and	has	been	around	a	thousand	years.	But
is	it	natural	or	unnatural?	We	don’t	know.	You	have	people	in	a	foreign	country	stepping	all	over	these
grapes,	putting	foot	fungus	in	there,	and	then	creating	a	fermented	thing	that	is	controlled.	I	don’t	think	that
wine	is	all	that	natural!	Every	time	you	turn	on	the	blender	and	puree	something,	you	are	crossing	the	line
of	natural	versus	unnatural.	Nature	did	not	intend	for	an	electric	motor	to	spin	a	blade	and	turn	a	solid	into
a	liquid.

If	you	think	an	unripe	green	tomato	tastes	better	than	a	ripe	heirloom	red	tomato	picked	off	the	vine	in

August,	then	by	all	means	eat	the	green	tomato.	That	is	flavor	preference.	What	if	I	feed	you	an	unripe
green	tomato	but	alter	its	taste	so	it	tastes	better	than	a	vine-ripened	red	tomato?	When	we	pick	it	off	the
vine	earlier,	it	has	a	different	quality	—	it	is	sharper.	So,	we	will	pair	something	that	maybe	should	nogo
with	it,	like	Parmesan	cheese	pureed	with	butter.	This	will	make	it	a	little	richer	and	compensate	for	the
overtannic,	overacidic	qualities	of	the	tomato.	[If	you	enjoy	it,]	then	you	have	succumbed	to	not	following
the	seasons.

In	the	same	manner,	we’ll	serve	a	dish	of	unripe	things	that	taste	ripe	because	they	are	together!	What

do	I	prefer?	Of	course	I	prefer	the	vine-ripened	tomato	at	the	end	of	August.	We	would	make	the	other
dish	just	to	ask	the	question.

Creating	New	Flavors	I	disagree	with	the	notion	that	there	are	no	new	flavors.	Maybe	there	are	no	new
products,	even	though	we	don’t	know	everything	that	exists	in	the	sea.	To	create	a	new	flavor,	all	you
have	to	do	is	dissect	an	ingredient.	For	example,	if	I	take	an	avocado	and	put	it	into	a	centrifuge,	we
would	separate	the	fat	and	the	water.	The	water	will	carry	the	avocado	taste.	If	I	take	that	water	and
create	a	snow	with	it	or	make	it	into	a	pill,	it	will	have	a	much	different	taste	than	avocado,	because
avocado	is	thought	of	as	something	that	is	rich.	But	there	would	be	no	richness	here;	it	is	a	completely
different	product.	We	just	made	up	a	new	flavor.

So	now	if	I	want	to	mimic	an	avocado,	I	would	have	to	serve	something	rich	with	it.	I	could	serve
something	dairy	with	it,	like	brown	butter.	I	now	have	something	that	would	go	with	a	classical	turbot
dish	with	brown	butter	and	capers,	whereas	fresh	avocado	would	not	have	paired	up	with	that	dish	very
well.

How	to	Lengthen	Flavors


Think	of	something	in	its	pure	form	like	passion	fruit	puree:	It	is	strong,	vibrant,	and	when	it	touches
your	tongue,	you	taste	it	[all	at	once].	I	learned	from	Heston	Blumenthal	[chef	of	The	Fat	Duck,	the
Michelin	three-star	restaurant	in	England]	that	if	you	take	that	same	passion	fruit	and	make	it	into	a
gelée	and	cube	it,	then	you	will	get	the	flavor	little	by	little	as	the	cube	melts	on	your	palate.	The
flavor	release	takes	longer	and	lasts	longer	in	your	mouth.
—	JOHNNY	IUZZINI,	PASTRY	CHEF,	JEAN	GEORGES	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Sometimes	we	try	to	lengthen	flavors,	like	you	have	with	some	wines	[e.g.,	wines	that	are
said	to	have	“a	long	finish”	that	you	taste	long	after	swallowing].	I	will	think,	“How	long	do	I
want	a	flavor	to	last?	Do	I	want	a	blast,	or	do	I	want	it	to	linger?”

We	make	a	dish	of	a	fried	oyster	with	shiso	and	a	wasabi,	yuzu,	and	sancho	pepper

[also	known	as	Szechuan	pepper]	sauce.	That	is	a	great	way	to	experience	length	of
flavor.	The	shiso	wraps	around	the	oyster	like	a	taco	shell.	When	you	take	a	bite,	you	get
the	herbaceous	punch	from	the	shiso,	then	richness	from	the	fried	oyster	that	coats	your
tongue.	Then	you	get	the	acid	from	the	yuzu	on	the	sides	of	your	tongue.	When	you
swallow	the	bite,	the	wasabi	comes	up	the	back	of	your	nose.	Then	you	get	a	small
surprise	because	the	pepper	gives	you	a	numbing	effect	across	your	palate.	This	is	not	a
“two	seconds	of	heaven”	bite;	we	are	talking	about	a	twenty-second	experience.	We	have
orchestrated	this	not	in	a	crazy	chemical	way,	but	just	by	playing	with	an	oyster.

The	cues	come	from	the	wine	world:	Sometimes	you	want	bright	and	spritzy	high-acid

flavor,	and	other	times	you	want	something	rich	and	long.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	Public	(New	York	City)

Katsuya	Fukushima	of	minibar	in	Washington,	DC

I	like	to	work	with	classic,	preexisting	flavor	combinations	that	people	can	recognize.	They	may	not
recognize	anything	from	the	textures	I	use,	but	they	will	find	recognition	in	the	flavors.

To	make	our	“Philly	Cheesesteak,”	we	start	with	the	bread.	We	put	pita	dough	through	a	pasta
machine	so	that	it	gets	really	thin,	but	puffs	way	up	when	you	cook	it.	For	the	cheese	element,	we	use	a
Vermont	and	Wisconsin	cheddar	cheese	mousse	that	we	pipe	into	the	pita.	For	the	beef,	we	serve	seared
Kobe	beef.	For	the	onions,	we	spread	on	caramelized	onion	puree.	We	then	top	that	with	truffles.	So	you
have	bread,	cheese,	beef,	and	onion,	just	like	a	Philly	cheesesteak.	We	add	the	truffles	just	to	push	it	over
the	top.

CHEFS’	STRATEGIES	FOR	BALANCING	FLAVORS

On	every	forkful	—	regardless	of	what’s	on	the	fork	—	there	has	to	be	salt,	acid,	and	heat.	.	.	.
However,	unless	you	are	serving	a	pepper-crusted	dish,	or	a	lemon	or	vinegar	dish,	your	seasoning
should	never	be	detected.	Instead,	your	beans	should	taste	like	beans,	and	your	rabbit	should	taste	like
rabbit.	Diners	don’t	need	to	know	how	much	salt,	acid,	and	heat	are	in	the	dish	—	and	none	should	be
obvious.	You’ll	also	have	minor	supporting	players	in	a	dish,	such	as	the	aromatic	or	picante	levels
that	might	come	from	your	mirepoix	or	sofrito	[a	well-cooked	sauce	of	tomatoes,	garlic,	onions,	and
herbs]	or	whatever	else	went	in	there.	But	when	a	diner	tastes	your	dishes,	all	you	want	them	to	be
thinking	about	is	those	beans,	or	that	rabbit.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)


Over	the	past	fifteen	years,	we	have	interviewed	many	chefs	in	an	effort	to	understand	how	some	of
America’s	best	chefs	approach	creating	great	food.	What	we	learned	is	that	there	are	as	many	approaches
as	chefs	themselves.	While	some	strategies	overlap,	others	are	unique	and	display	strong	self-knowledge
as	to	what	makes	their	individual	cuisines	so	original	and	compelling.

Traci	Des	Jardins	of	Jardinière	in	San	Francisco

The	most	important	aspect	of	any	dish	is	balance	—	between	acid,	fat,	salt,	and	sweetness.	It	is	the	key	to
making	food	taste	good.

The	same	is	true	in	pastry.	I	am	constantly	working	with	my	pastry	chef	when	I	taste	desserts	with	her.
I	will	taste	something	and	say	it	is	too	sweet	—	that	it	is	missing	the	acid	balance,	and	needs	some	faand
a	little	salt.	Using	salt	in	pastry	brings	out	the	flavor,	just	as	it	does	in	savory	food.	When	it	comes	to
dessert,	people	think	more	in	a	“monochromatic”	sweet	fashion.	But	sweets	need	balance,	too.

My	favorite	flavor	is	the	harmony	of	these	elements	working	together,	whether	it	is	sweet	or	savory.

Marcel	Desaulniers	of	The	Trellis	in	Williamsburg,	Virginia

My	cooking	philosophy	has	always	been	simple:	Don’t	complicate	things,	and	let	the	food	speak	for	itself.
I	want	the	food	to	leave	a	clean	taste	in	your	mouth,	and	that	goes	for	savory	food	as	well	as	desserts.
We	don’t	use	a	lot	of	spices	because	they	can	have	an	intensity	of	flavor	that	can	overwhelm	other
flavors.	People	can’t	restrain	themselves	with	certain	ingredients	—	and,	often,	it’s	garlic.	At	The	Trellis,
we	use	garlic	in	only	one	recipe:	a	dressing	that	has	been	on	the	menu	for	twenty-six	years.	Herbs	can	be
overused	as	well,	too.	Rosemary	and	basil,	which	I	love,	are	constantly	overused,	which	results	in	a
bitter	flavor.

I	tell	cooks,	“When	in	doubt,	don’t	use	it.”	The	food	you	are	starting	with	already	has	its	own
intrinsic	flavor,	whether	it	is	a	scallop	or	a	filet	of	beef.	Whatever	you	do	to	embellish	the	flavor	should
be	a	very	minor	part	of	the	relationship,	rather	than	sharing	the	stage	fifty-fifty.

I	thought	of	myself	as	a	saucier	from	my	days	in	New	York,	yet	when	I	opened	this	restaurant	in

Williamsburg,	it	was	not	the	way	I	wanted	to	present	the	food.	Rather	than	sauces,	I	wanted	to	use
vegetables	and	fruits	as	the	accompaniments.	They	provide	moisture	as	a	natural	component	and	they
work	on	the	plate,	but	not	as	a	fifty-fifty	partner.

An	example	of	where	fruit	works	great	as	a	component	is	on	our	pork	dish:	We	serve	pork	loin
medallions,	grilled	sausage,	sweet	potatoes,	tender	cooked	string	beans,	and	bourbon-glazed	peaches.	So
this	is	a	dish	with	no	sauce,	except	the	juice	from	the	peaches.

Carrie	Nahabedian	of	Naha	in	Chicago

You	should	always	season	something	right	from	the	start,	and	not	just	at	the	end.	If	you	just	add	salt	and
pepper	at	the	end,	you	are	not	doing	a	soup	justice.	You	want	those	flavors	to	blossom.

Take	our	butternut	squash	soup	as	an	example.	We	start	our	soup	with	hefty	pieces	of	slab	bacon,	so
we	are	already	starting	off	with	a	lot	of	flavor.	From	there,	we	add	the	mirepoix	and	make	sure	it	gets	nice
and	caramelized.	Then	we	start	adding	our	salt,	fresh-cracked	pepper,	and	thyme	sprig.

Next,	we	add	roasted	squash.	The	reason	we	roast	it	before	it	goes	in	the	soup	is	because	you	can
taste	what	state	the	squash	is	in.	It	may	need	a	little	help	because	it	needed	to	age	a	couple	more	weeks	in
the	cellar	before	we	got	it,	so	we	may	add	a	garnet	yam.	Now,	we	taste	the	soup	and	decide	what	kind	of
sweetness	to	add.	That	could	be	honey,	molasses,	or	maple	sugar	—	not	just	[white]	sugar.

Next,	we	puree	the	soup	and	pass	it	[through	a	fine-mesh	strainer]	to	achieve	its	smooth	texture.


To	the	soup	base,	we	add	the	garnishes.	We	already	have	bacon,	but	some	smoked	duck	will	be	good,

too.	We	add	spaghetti	squash	and	fried	parsnips	for	additional	texture	and,	in	the	case	of	the	parsnips,
sweetness	as	well.	For	a	last	note,	we	add	a	drizzle	of	maple	syrup	or	barrel-aged	sherry.	These	things
just	seal	the	soup	so	that	the	flavors	all	escalate.	It	is	important	to	not	rush	things	so	that	your	flavors
come	together.

Andrew	Carmellini	of	A	Voce	in	New	York	City

Any	kind	of	sauce	boils	down	to	acid,	salt,	sweetness,	and	two	kinds	of	spice:	savory	spice,	meaning
cumin-	or	coriander-type	spices,	and	heat	spice,	meaning	chiles	or	pepper	flakes.	You	can	be	making	a
vinaigrette	or	a	Thai	curry	or	a	bouillabaisse,	but	its	seasoning	involves	the	same	principles	on	the	palate.
As	long	as	you	can	manipulate	those	things,	you	can	get	your	palate	excited.

If	something	is	heavy	or	fatty	on	the	tongue,	add	some	vinegar	or	lemon	or	another	type	of	acid.	If	you

were	making	a	Thai-style	coconut	curry	that	is	too	fatty	and	rich	from	the	coconut	milk,	you	would	add
some	grated	lime	zest,	lime	juice,	and	a	splash	of	fish	sauce	to	cut	the	richness.

When	you	are	adjusting	the	seasoning	of	a	dish,	you	need	to	think	about	its	origin.	That	is	why

traveling	is	so	important.	For	example,	you	wouldn’t	use	rice	wine	vinegar	in	a	French	bouillabaisse,	but
you	might	use	a	little	bit	of	chili	flakes.	You	must	understand	the	historical	context	of	a	dish,	which	is	why
you	wouldn’t	thicken	an	Indian	curry	with	strawberries.

Sharon	Hage	of	York	Street	in	Dallas

When	I	am	building	a	dish,	I	use	a	tray	we	call	“the	four	seasons,”	which	is	fleur	de	sel	[salt];	repepper
flakes,	the	ultimate	marriage	of	heat	and	fruit;	dry	mustard,	which	I	use	all	the	time;	and	sumac,	which	is
an	acidic	component.

When	I	make	a	dish,	it	starts	with	the	dry	ingredients	first,	and	the	salt	is	the	first	dry	ingredient.	Then

I	add	the	heat	layer,	such	as	a	jalapeño	or	horseradish.	Then	I	add	acid:	lemon	juice,	vinegar,	verjus,	or
all	three.	Then,	at	the	last	second,	I	add	the	fat	component	—	the	oil	or	butter	—	to	the	sauce,	which
brings	it	all	together.

Brad	Farmerie	of	Public	in	New	York	City


When	I	come	up	with	a	new	dish,	I	am	looking	at	two	things:	The	first	is	building	up	the	richness,	anthe
second	is	cutting	that	richness	with	acidity,	spice,	or	herbaceousness.

I	start	by	thinking,	What	is	the	rich	component?	How	can	I	build	richness?	If	it	is	a	protein,	wemay
cure	the	meat	or	fry	the	fish.	If	it	is	a	vegetarian	dish,	I	may	start	with	eggplant,	which	is	meaty,	sowill
build	it	up	with	miso	or	tahini,	which	will	make	it	even	richer	and	meatier.	This	is	really	important	in	a
vegetarian	dish,	because	I	hate	those	flimsy	veg	plates	of	grilled	vegetables	and	a	lot	of	salad!

Texture	is	another	way	of	building	richness.	If	you	add	miso	or	tahini,	that	adds	richness	and	texture.

An	emulsification	also	gives	a	sense	of	richness	in	your	mind	and	across	your	palate.	One	way	to	add	rich
texture	in	a	“fakey-jakey”	way	is	to	add	palm	sugar.	It	is	[a	less]	sweet	sugar,	and	we	will	shave	it	into	a
dish	halfway	through	the	cooking	and	temper	it	with	tamarind.	We	use	it	so	subtly	that	you	don’t	even
know	it	is	there.

Now	that	I	have	my	richness,	the	question	becomes,	“How	can	we	cut	that	richness	so	it	is	light	onthe

palate	and	in	the	belly?”	We	use	a	tremendous	amount	of	acid,	but	it	is	always	in	check	with	what	is	on
the	plate.	Choosing	the	right	acid	or	herb	will	leave	a	light	feeling	on	the	palate	and	cut	a	rich	dish.
With	any	fried	food,	you	need	a	big	zap	of	acidity	to	get	through	it.	With	fried	fish,	we	will	use

preserved	lemon,	yogurt,	or	yuzu	with	a	white	soy	dipping	sauce.

Cured	meat	is	almost	the	epitome	of	richness.	Cured	meats	have	a	salinity	to	them,	and	quite	often
there	is	sugar	to	balance	the	salt	as	well.	You	need	some	punchy	flavors	to	cut	the	meat,	or	it	will	just	be
heavy	on	the	palate.	Traditionally,	you	would	use	capers	or	caper	berries.	Mustard	fruits	[known	in	Italy
as	mostarda,	these	are	fruits	preserved	in	mustard-flavored	sweet	syrup]	are	another	traditional
approach.	I	like	them	because	you	have	the	added	element	of	spice.	We	make	our	own	mustard	fruits	and
bastardize	them	a	little	by	using	kumquats,	baby	apricots,	and	gooseberries,	which	are	not	traditional	in
Italy.	These	fruits	simply	have	beautiful	flavor	and	color.	The	other	thing	we	do	is	use	whole	mustard
seeds.	Mustard	fruits	are	typically	[made	through]	a	refined	process	in	that	they	become	like	a	clear	jam.
We	leave	ours	a	little	rougher	and	fold	in	a	little	dry	mustard	in	the	end	to	make	the	colors	of	the	citrus
fruits	really	pop.

Another	way	we	cut	richness	is	by	using	sweet-and-sour	poached	vegetables	and	fruit.	We’ll	poach
fennel	or	pearl	onions	in	a	sweet-sour	liquid	with	licorice	and	star	anise.	The	family	of	apples,	pears,	and
quince	also	holds	up	very	well,	as	do	sour	poached	plums.

I	like	aromatic	spices	[for	their	ability	to	cut	richness].	If	I’m	working	on	a	dish	inspired	by	India,	my
inspirations	are	the	flavors	of	clove,	cardamom,	and	coriander	seed.	They	are	aromatic	spices	that	really
cut	the	fat	of	a	dish,	so	the	dish	is	not	big,	fat,	and	flabby	on	the	palate.	Fresh	turmeric	gives	you	fruitiness
and	upfront	flavor	with	a	touch	of	acid	that	perks	up	a	dish.	If	you	add	fresh	turmeric	to	your	curry,	you
will	make	a	world	of	difference	by	adding	this	one	small	thing.

If	I’m	working	on	a	dish	inspired	by	Southeast	Asia,	I	like	galangal,	lemongrass,	and	ginger.	They	all
have	natural	acidity	and	zingy	spice	that	will	perk	up	anything.	Even	if	you	are	not	adding	acid	to	coconut
milk	but	just	adding	aromatics,	it	won’t	taste	heavy.

Emily	Luchetti,	pastry	chef	at	Farallon	in	San	Francisco

I	want	my	flavors	to	be	clean,	crisp,	accentuated,	and	distinguished.	From	there,	I	look	at	what	I	feel	like
making.	If	I	have	peaches,	do	I	want	to	make	a	trifle	or	a	napoleon	or	something	else?	What	is	thstar	of
the	plate?	Is	it	one	thing	and	everything	else	is	going	to	be	showing	it	off?	Or	are	there	two	main	flavors
that	are	both	going	to	have	equal	billing?	I	make	a	peach-blueberry	trifle	that	has	a	mascarpone	cream	and
is	pretty	intense.	It	is	one	of	my	favorite	summer	things	to	make.	The	peaches	and	blueberries	are	both	the


stars.	If	you	make	a	pumpkin-cranberry	upside-down	cake,	the	pumpkin	is	the	star	and	the	cranberry	is	an
accent.

You	have	to	look	at	the	ingredient	and	ask,	“How	am	I	going	to	bring	out	the	best	of	its	flavors?	DoI
cook	it,	or	leave	it	alone?	Does	this	piece	of	fruit	need	to	be	intensified	because	it	wants	to	be	the	star,	or
is	it	not	good	enough	on	its	own?”	When	you	are	working	with	fresh	or	dried	fruit,	the	most	important
thing	is	the	balance	of	sugar,	salt,	and	lemon.	If	I	am	mixing	fresh	fruit	for	a	shortcake	or	crisp,	I	always
add	some	lemon	juice	and	salt,	because	—	just	like	in	savory	cooking	—	it	helps	bring	out	the	flavor.	We
are	talking	a	half	teaspoon	to	a	teaspoon	of	lemon	and	a	large	pinch	of	kosher	salt.

Whenever	you	are	cooking	fruit	with	sugar	to	serve	with	something,	taste	the	fruit	first.	If	it	is	the

peak	of	summer,	that	fruit	may	not	need	sugar.	If	you	added	some	anyway,	it	would	dull	the	flavors	and
make	it	taste	too	sweet.	So,	taste	your	fruit	—	and	trust	your	palate!	People	trust	their	palates	for	savory
food	all	the	time.	They’ll	taste	a	tomato	sauce	and	know	it	needs	some	salt.	You	need	to	trust	your	palate
for	sugar	as	well.	You	know	when	something	is	too	sugary	or	salty.

When	you	are	working	with	fresh	fruit,	the	fruit	has	to	be	the	guide.	If	you	eat	a	piece	of	fresh	fruit	by
itself,	it	is	a	dessert.	So	you	want	the	dessert,	in	the	end,	to	taste	better	than	the	fruit	itself.	To	dothat,	you
need	to	add	things	that	go	naturally.	Blueberries	and	peaches	go	well	together.	Vanilla	goes	with
practically	any	fruit.	Almonds	go	with	most	fruits	because	they	are	light	nuts	that	have	a	lot	of	flavor	but
not	a	lot	of	fat.	Just	starting	with	things	that	naturally	go	together,	you	will	have	a	greater	rate	of	success.

People	will	read	that	I	think	three	flavors	work	in	a	dessert	—	then	they’ll	say,	“Well,	you	used	four.	.

.	.”	That	is	not	the	point	—	the	point	is	knowing	when	to	stop!	Too	many	chefs	start	adding	things	that	in
the	end	all	taste	muddled,	because	nothing	can	stand	out	on	its	own.	When	you	are	more	restrictive,	each
thing	tastes	good	on	its	own	—	and	the	dessert	becomes	more	than	the	sum	of	its	parts.	It	is	hard	to	know
when	to	stop.	Many	chefs	seem	to	think,	“Oh,	I’ll	just	add	this	dot	of	mango.	.	.	.”	Well,	the	taste	of	that
one	acidic	dot	can	set	the	whole	dessert	off.

Flavor	is	a	“language”	that	anyone	who	loves	the	pleasures	of	the	palate	will	find	to	be	well	worth
mastering.	Once	you	master	the	language	of	flavor,	you	can	use	it	to	communicate	—	and	become	a	better
cook.

GREAT	COOKING	=	MAXIMIZING	FLAVOR	+	PLEASURE	BY
TAPPING	BODY	+	HEART	+	MIND	+	SPIRIT:	COMMUNICATING
VIA	THE	LANGUAGE	OF	FOOD

Happy	and	successful	cooking	doesn’t	rely	only	on	know-how.	It	comes	from	the	heart,	makes	great
demands	on	the	palate,	and	needs	enthusiasm	and	a	deep	love	of	food	to	bring	it	to	life.

—	GEORGES	BLANC,	MICHELIN	THREE-STAR	CHEF	IN	VONNAS,	FRANCE


The	defining	trait	of	a	great	cook	is	more	than	a	great	palate,	and	more	than	great	technique;	it	is	sound
judgment.	It	is	not	only	knowing	what	to	do	with	ingredients,	but	also	when,	where,	why,	and	how	to	serve
them.	Cooking	involves	the	thoughtful	combination	and	manipulation	of	ingredients.	Good	cooking	results
in	those	ingredients	tasting	even	better.	Great	cooking	not	only	celebrates	the	ingredients,	but	also
celebrates	the	moment.

Recipes	evolved	as	a	way	to	teach	less	experienced	cooks	how	to	prepare	particular	dishes,	by
providing	specific	proportions	of	compatible	ingredients	along	with	step-by-step	instructions.	However,
anyone	who	believes	that	every	recipe	followed	verbatim	will	always	produce	consistent	results	is
kidding	themselves,	given	the	diversity	within	individual	ingredients,	whether	the	sweetness	of	fruit	or	the
thickness	of	a	fish	fillet.	Slavish	followers	of	recipes,	who	treat	them	as	gospel	instead	of	guidelines,
make	the	mistake	of	putting	more	faith	in	someone	else’s	instructions	than	they	do	in	themselves.	Many
people	would	do	better	in	the	kitchen	if	they	didn’t	blindly	follow	recipes.	In	fact,	following	recipes	may
be	holding	you	back	from	achieving	your	potential	as	a	cook.

Take	the	time	to	learn	and	master	some	of	the	general	principles	of	how	to	make	food	taste	great	—

such	as	what	to	pair	with	various	ingredients,	and	how	to	prepare	them	—	which	is	the	subject	of	this
book.	After	all,	more	than	a	dozen	years	after	the	advent	of	the	Food	Network	turned	every	TV	set	in	this
country	into	a	virtual	24/7	cooking	school,	supplementing	the	burgeoning	food	programming	on	many	of
the	other	major	channels,	Americans	are	better-trained	cooks	than	at	any	previous	point	in	history.	Most	of
us	can	now	whip	up	a	dish	with	our	general	knowledge	of	how	to	boil	pasta,	sauté	an	onion,	or	grill	a
steak.	Today,	long,	detailed	recipes	are	rarely	needed	for	most	cooking	(with	the	exception	of	baking,
whose	chemistry	requires	precise	measurements).

Training	wheels	can	be	useful	when	first	learning	to	ride	a	bike,	as	can	“painting	by	numbers”	when

first	learning	to	paint.	Likewise,	following	a	recipe	can	be	useful	when	first	learning	to	cook	—	for
understanding	the	order	of	completing	certain	steps,	and	internalizing	their	intrinsic	logic.	But	great
cooking	should	be	more	akin	to	meditation:	you	—	and	all	of	your	senses	—	are	in	the	moment,	and	fully
awake	and	aware.	You	can	taste	the	ingredients,	and	know	what	you	need	to	do	to	make	them	taste	their
best.	You	know,	as	chef	Judy	Rodgers	famously	told	us	for	our	book	Becoming	a	Chef,	to	“look	out	the
window	and	see	what	the	weather	is	and	decide	what	the	soup	wants	to	be.”	Be	fully	grounded	in	the
moment	that	is	part	of	that	second,	that	minute,	that	hour,	that	day,	that	month,	that	season,	that	year	of	your
life	—	all	at	once.

To	elevate	your	cooking	to	a	whole	new	level,	develop	a	better	appreciation	for	the	essence	of
ingredients,	which	provides	insight	into	when	and	how	to	best	use	them.	Celebrating	the	essence	of
ingredients	allows	you	to	work	with	them	more	intuitively	and	effectively.	This	book	will	help	you	decide
what	ingredients	to	reach	for	in	the	kitchen,	and	why,	and	what	to	do	with	them	when	you	do.

HOW	TO	MAKE	FOOD	TASTE	GREAT

A	great	cook	is	able	to	make	food	taste	great	by	doing	two	basic	things:

1.	Understanding	the	essence	of	the	moment,	which	comprises	everything	from	the	meal’s	driving
force	to	the	occasion,	to	the	weather,	to	the	available	time,	budget,	and/or	other	resources	(for
example,	ingredients,	equipment,	etc.).

2.	Understanding	the	essence	of	the	ingredients,	which	comprises	their	season,	regionality,

weight	and	volume,	function,	flavor,	and/or	flavor	affinities.


The	deeper	your	understanding	of	both,	the	greater	your	ability	to	bring	them	together	into	a	dish	that	is	the
perfect	expression	of	the	ingredients	and	the	moment.

Understanding	the	Essence	of	the	Moment

Why	do	you	need	or	want	to	cook	in	the	first	place?	In	a	day	and	age	when	more	of	the	meals	we	consume
are	prepared	outside	the	home	than	at	home,	cooking	has	become	relatively	infrequent.	So,	what’s	driving
you?

Always	keep	in	mind	your	starting	point	in	the	kitchen,	the	reference	point	serving	as	the	inspiration

for	your	cooking	—	which	can	be	virtually	anything.	Following	its	essence	logically	or	intuitively	will
lead	you	to	each	subsequent	step	toward	creating	something	delicious.	Your	starting	point	is	your	initial
desire.	It	may	be	an	ingredient,	or	a	dish,	or	a	country:	you’re	excited	to	prepare	the	first	heirloom
tomatoes	of	summer;	you’re	craving	your	grandmother’s	cheesecake;	or	you	want	a	dish	that	will	take	you
to	Italy	to	relive	the	flavors	you	enjoyed	on	your	last	vacation.

Other	factors	provide	the	parameters	of	how	you’ll	act	on	that	desire.	They	might	be	time	(“I	want	to

spend	the	day	cooking	for	pleasure”	versus	“I	have	only	fifteen	minutes	to	get	something	on	the	table”),
budget	($5/person	versus	“money	is	no	object,	so	bring	on	the	truffles”),	occasion	(dinner	on	a	Tuesday
night,	or	someone’s	birthday),	availability	of	ingredients	(your	neighbors	just	gave	you	fresh	vegetables
from	their	garden),	season	(the	arrival	of	the	first	asparagus	of	spring,	or	the	last	corn	of	Indian	summer),
weather	(wanting	a	chilled	lunch	to	help	you	cool	off	on	a	hot	summer	day),	or	something	else.

Your	starting	point,	whatever	it	is,	has	an	essence:	Your	desire	to	host	a	barbecue	to	celebrate	the
beautiful	summer	weather	will	bring	up	associations	that	will	in	turn	bring	up	other	associations,	until	you
have	a	long	list	of	associations,	for	example:

•	Desire	to	enjoy	the	80-degree	sunny	summer	day	(starting	point:	season,	weather)

→		Have	a	summer	barbecue	(craving)
→		Invite	friends	over	to	enjoy	it,	too

•	Prefer	to	cool	down	(function)

→		Serve	cold	drinks
→		Serve	at	least	some	chilled	dishes

•	Serve	corn	bought	at	the	market	this	morning	(available	resources)

→		Serve	corn	salsa	on	grilled	chicken	or	fish
→		Serve	corn	on	the	cob

•	Have	best	friends	over	for	dinner	(guests)

→		Everyone	eats	chicken
→		One	of	them	is	from	New	England	and	can	bring	lobster

•	Avoid	turning	the	oven	on	(temperature)

→		Cook	outside	’	fire	up	the	grill
→		Cook	on	the	stovetop	only	’	boil	water

So,	starting	with	your	driving	factor	and	its	essence,	you	can	follow	these	associations	to	their	logical

conclusion	and	come	up	with	the	perfect	meal.	For	one	person,	it	might	be	serving	grilled	chicken	with	a
corn	salsa	in	the	backyard.	For	another,	it	might	be	hosting	a	lobster	and	corn	boil	in	an	air-conditioned
dining	room.	It’s	all	about	taking	everything	into	consideration	at	once,	and	using	sound	judgment	to
determine	how	to	proceed.


Occasion

Even	if	it	wasn’t	the	driving	force	behind	why	you’re	cooking	in	the	first	place,	you’ll	still	want	to
consider	the	importance	and	significance	of	the	meal.	A	quick	dinner	on	a	time-pressed	weeknight	will	be
different	from	a	dinner	made	on	the	weekend	when	there	is	more	time	to	enjoy	the	sensual	process	of
cooking.	Keep	the	occasion	in	mind	when	planning	your	meal,	with	the	knowledge	that	any	meal	can	be
elevated	to	a	special	occasion	—	or	simplified	in	a	crunch.	The	elements	of	breakfast	take	on	a	different
level	of	importance	when	they	are	used	for	a	special	brunch.	A	quick	fried	egg	and	a	toasted	English
muffin	on	a	Tuesday	can	morph	into	poached	eggs	with	Canadian	bacon	with	hollandaise	sauce	on	an
English	muffin	for	a	weekend	brunch,	or	vice	versa.

But	a	true	special	occasion	—	a	birthday,	anniversary,	or	holiday	—	definitely	calls	for	something
equally	special	to	celebrate	it.	If	lack	of	time	is	a	factor,	a	birthday	isn’t	the	time	to	undertake	making	and
decorating	a	cake	from	scratch.	However,	it	might	inspire	you	to	pick	up	a	half	gallon	of	the	birthday	boy
or	girl’s	favorite	ice	cream,	toast	some	pecans,	and	whip	up	some	homemade	chocolate	sauce	—	which
would	take	only	minutes,	as	opposed	to	hours.

Weather

While	seasonality	will	drive	your	choice	of	ingredients,	the	weather	will	drive	your	decision	as	to	how	to
prepare	and	serve	them.	On	the	coldest	days,	you’ll	want	to	warm	your	home	as	well	as	your	body	with
slow-braised	dishes,	soups,	and	stews,	and	on	warmer	days,	you’ll	want	to	keep	your	home	(and
yourself)	cooler	by	doing	more	grilling	or	on	the	hottest	days	serving	quick-cooked	or	even	chilled	dishes
—	no	matter	what	season	those	days	may	fall	in.

Some	cooks	believe	you	can	serve	anything	at	any	time	of	the	year.	Our	eyebrows	have	raised	upon

seeing	heavy	braised	dishes	on	restaurant	menus	in	August.	However,	chefs	have	defended	them	by
arguing	that	once	someone	is	seated	in	an	air-conditioned	dining	room,	they	forget	what	it’s	like	outside!
Those	chefs	may	be	giving	customers	what	they	want	while	they	are	at	the	table	.	.	.	but	what	happens
when	those	same	customers	leave	the	restaurant	after	finishing	their	braised	short	ribs	and	walk	out	into
the	heat	and	humidity?	They	might	feel	as	out	of	sorts	as	they	would	wearing	long	wool	overcoats	on	such
a	night!	A	lighter	meal	on	a	hot	night	won’t	sap	your	energy	in	the	same	way.	Even	in	the	middle	of
summer,	there	will	be	unseasonably	cool	days	that	might	suggest	a	warm	dish	that	would	offend	the


sensibilities	on	the	season’s	hottest,	most	sweltering	day.	Even	during	the	dead	of	winter,	the	sun	can
break	through	and	create	an	unseasonably	warm	day	on	which	hot,	slow-cooked	braised	dishes	would	not
be	appealing.

Considering	the	weather	means	taking	into	consideration	the	natural	rhythms	of	nature.	One	of	the
easiest	clues	available	to	inform	your	cooking	is	to	look	out	the	window,	and	ask	yourself	what	you	feel
like	eating.	If	you	look	out	the	window	on	a	sunny	summer	morning,	are	you	more	tempted	by	hot	oatmeal
—	or	by	granola	and	yogurt?	That	afternoon,	as	the	temperature	rises,	does	your	mouth	water	thinking	of
hot	tomato	soup	—	or	chilled	gazpacho?	That	night,	does	the	temperature	fall	enough	to	make	you	want	to
turn	on	the	oven	to	roast	a	chicken	—	or	would	you	rather	grill	it	on	your	stovetop?

On	our	first	visit	to	a	certain	New	York	City	restaurant	on	one	of	the	hottest	nights	of	summer,	we
were	surprised	to	be	sent	an	amuse-bouche	from	the	kitchen	that	was	a	tall	glass	of	hot	yellow	pepper
soup.	While	the	soup	itself	might	have	been	made	from	seasonal	ingredients	and	tasty	in	a	vacuum,
unfortunately	what	we	remember	even	more	vividly	was	how	unappealing	we	found	it,	especially	as	our
first	taste	after	a	sweltering	taxi	ride	to	the	restaurant.	If	the	same	soup	had	been	served	to	us	cold,	we
expect	it	would	have	been	more	successful	as	the	welcoming	gesture	it	was	intended	to	be.

Understanding	the	Essence	of	the	Ingredients

Once	you’re	clear	about	“the	problem”	of	what	to	cook,	the	right	ingredients,	well	prepared,	provide	the
ideal	“solution.”	To	prepare	any	ingredients	well,	it’s	vital	to	understand	and	respect	their	essence.

What	do	we	mean	when	we	talk	about	an	ingredient’s	“essence”?	Every	ingredient	has	associations
with	it,	and	the	sum	total	of	those	associations	comprises	its	essence.	An	ingredient’s	essence	is	more	than
its	flavor.	Take	two	sample	ingredients,	both	salty:

•	What	comes	to	mind	when	you	think	of	soy	sauce?	Common	associations	besides	its	saltiness


might	include	Asia	(region),	rice	(as	a	common	flavoring	for),	and/or	scallions	(compatible
ingredient).

•	What	comes	to	mind	when	you	think	of	Parmesan	cheese?	Aside	from	saltiness	(flavor),	its
common	associations	might	include	Italy	(region),	pasta	or	pizza	(which	it	is	a	common
flavoring	for),	and/or	basil	and	tomatoes	(compatible	ingredients).

While	certain	other	ingredients	—	such	as	chicken,	garlic,	and	onions,	which	are	all	used	around	the
world	—	may	be	neutral	in	their	universality,	many	ingredients	are	rooted	in	distinct	associations.

Some	of	the	primary	aspects	of	any	ingredient’s	essence	include	its	seasonality,	its	taste,	its	volume,

its	function,	its	regionality,	its	weight,	and	its	flavor	affinities.	While	the	importance	of	each	factor
varies,	depending	on	the	dish,	the	goal	when	cooking	is	to	ensure	that	all	of	these	factors	are	respected	in
the	ingredient’s	use.

Seasonality

It	is	almost	a	cliché	to	talk	about	seasonality	if	you	are	a	New	American	chef.	You	are	cooking	that	way
naturally.	I	had	a	customer	complain	that	his	favorite	pea	ravioli	was	not	on	the	menu.	I	explained
that	peas	were	not	very	good	at	the	time,	so	that	we	were	featuring	corn	ravioli.	I	don’t	focus	on
making	an	ingredient	that	is	not	at	its	peak	taste	better;	I	simply	take	it	off	the	menu.	Chefs	still	pay
more	attention	to	seasonality	than	customers	do.	We	still	have	diners	who	want	berries	in	the	middle	of
February!
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Cooking	with	ingredients	at	their	seasonal	peak	is	such	a	central	tenet	of	good	cooking	that	it	bears
constant	repeating.	In	stores	across	the	country,	you	can	find	almost	any	ingredient	at	almost	any	time	of
year.	However,	an	ingredient’s	mere	availability	offers	no	assurances	of	its	quality.

Each	season	suggests	a	different	palette	of	ingredients,	and	different	ways	of	preparing	and	serving

them.	Classic	holiday	dishes	represent	time-tested	ways	of	celebrating	the	season:	Picture	a	grilled
hamburger	followed	by	a	red,	white,	and	blue	strawberry	shortcake	accented	with	blueberries	and
whipped	cream	served	on	the	Fourth	of	July,	or	roasted	turkey	with	stuffing,	cranberry	sauce,	and	pumpkin
pie	on	Thanksgiving.	(If	you’re	not	convinced	of	the	perfection	of	each	dish’s	expression	of	the	season
and	occasion,	just	imagine	eating	each	menu	on	the	other	holiday!)	Each	season	also	suggests	its	own
beverages;	for	example,	summer	calls	more	often	for	lighter-bodied	white	and	rosé	wines,	just	as	winter
calls	for	fuller-bodied	reds.

Taste

Every	ingredient	has	its	stereotypical	taste	(bananas	are	sweet),	plus	its	actual	taste,	which	may	be	a
function	of	its	age	or	ripeness.	For	example,	a	banana	may	increase	noticeably	in	sweetness	as	it	ripens
and	its	color	changes	from	green	to	yellow	to	brown.	That	is	why	it’s	crucial	to	taste	your	ingredients
when	cooking.	If	you	don’t	—	and,	as	a	result,	don’t	end	up	making	other	adjustments	(for	example,
slightly	decreasing	the	amount	of	sugar	used	when	using	very	ripe	bananas)	—	you’ll	find	your	dishes	to
be	out	of	balance.	Even	seemingly	similar	ingredients	(such	as	regular	versus	aged	balsamic	vinegar,	or
Italian	versus	Thai	basil)	can	vary	dramatically.


York	Street’s	Sharon	Hage	on	Classic	Flavor	Pairings
I	try	to	eat	a	lot	of	different	foods	and	read	a	lot	of	different	types	of	books	to	try	to	break
away	from	classic	pairings.	I	have	had	a	million	pork	dishes,	and	I	keep	thinking	that	there
has	to	be	something	else	besides	pork	with	sage!	I	try	all	these	different	things	then	turn	to
another	cook	and	say,	“Got	any	sage?”

There	is	a	reason	for	tomatoes	with	basil,	and	for	lamb	with	mint.	What	I	don’t	make	is

lamb	with	mint	jelly	—	but	there	will	likely	be	some	mint	someplace	on	the	dish.

Roasted	beets	work	with	salty	cheese,	whether	it	is	[Italian]	ricotta	salata,	or	[Mexican]

queso	fresco,	or	another	country’s	version	of	salty	cheese.

The	fun	part	is	to	discover	what	the	classic	pairing	is,	then	present	it	to	people	in	a	way
that	makes	them	think	it	is	different,	while	still	being	true	to	you	as	a	chef.	It	would	be	hard
to	imagine	summer	tomatoes	without	the	basil	component.	We	might	add	some	chives	or
mint	or	sumac,	but	the	dish	will	still	have	some	basil	as	well.

Weight

It	was	through	our	study	of	wine	that	we	developed	an	appreciation	for	the	critical	role	of	understanding	a
wine’s	body,	or	weight	—	and,	in	turn,	the	relative	weights	of	various	foods.	In	fact,	weight	has	eclipsed
color	as	the	key	factor	in	pairing	wine	with	food.

Weight	and	season	often	go	hand	in	hand,	as	we	crave	lightness	in	summer	and	heavier	dishes	when

temperatures	fall.	In	summer,	that	craving	for	lightness	could	be	satisfied	with	a	salad	of	fresh	greens
topped	with	shrimp	or	chicken	and	tossed	in	a	vinaigrette.	Our	winter	cravings	for	more	substance	and
warmth	might	lead	us	to	a	hearty	stew	made	with	red	meat	and	root	vegetables	in	their	own	thick	sauce.
There	is	a	spectrum	of	wine	and	ingredients	that	suggests	itself	for	warmer	versus	cooler	seasons	or

days,	as	well	as	for	lighter	versus	heavier	appetites:
Light
Medium
White	Wines Riesling
Red	Wines Pinot	Noir
Vegetables Bibb	lettuce
Grains
Fruits
Seafood
White	Meat
Red	Meat
Sauces

Heavy
Sauvignon	Blanc
Merlot

Apples
Salmon,	tuna
Chicken,	pork,	veal

Volume

Chardonnay
Cabernet	Sauvignon
Celery	root
Bulgur	wheat
Bananas

Beef,	lamb,	venison

Citrus/lemon	Vinaigrette Butter/cream	Olive	oil Demi-glace	Meat	stock

One	important	aspect	of	an	ingredient’s	flavor	essence	is	its	“volume.”	Think	of	a	stereo	dial	with	“1”
indicating	a	“quiet”	seasoning	of	chopped	parsley,	and	“10”	suggesting	a	“loud”	mound	of	freshly
chopped	habanero	chile	peppers.	You’ll	use	them	very	differently	to	create	very	different	effects,	while
striving	to	achieve	the	same	all-important	balance	in	the	final	dish.

So,	is	the	ingredient	you’re	working	with	quiet,	moderate,	or	loud?	You	need	to	be	aware	of	an
ingredient’s	volume	whenever	combining	it	with	other	ingredients.	If	a	dish	is	overspiced	to	the	point


where	you	can’t	taste	its	essence,	it’s	wrong.	Consider:

Proteins

Light	and/or	quiet:	fish,	shellfish,	tofu
Medium	and/or	moderate:	white	meat	(chicken,	pork,	veal)
Heavy	and/or	loud:	red	meat	(beef,	lamb,	venison)

Cooking	Techniques

Light	and/or	quiet:	poaching,	steaming
Medium	and/or	moderate:	frying,	sautéing
Heavy	and/or	loud:	braising,	stewing

Herbs

Function

Light	and/or	quiet:	chervil,	parsley
Medium	and/or	moderate:	dill,	lemon	thyme
Heavy	and/or	loud:	rosemary,	tarragon

Different	tastes	serve	different	functions.	Saltiness	stimulates	thirst	(think	of	all	those	free	salty	peanuts	in
bars!),	while	sourness	quenches	it	(think	lemonade).	Saltiness	heightens	the	appetite,	making	this	flavor
especially	effective	in	appetizers.	Bitterness	also	stimulates	the	appetite,	and	can	promote	the	other	tastes
with	which	it	is	paired	while	adding	a	note	of	lightness	to	a	dish.	Sourness	is	refreshing,	and	adds	a	fresh
note	to	any	dish	to	which	it	is	added.	Sweetness	is	famously	satiating,	making	it	ideal	(not	to	mention
customary)	to	end	a	meal	with	a	sweet	dessert,	or	at	least	a	sweet	note	(such	as	a	cheese	course	with


honey	or	sweet	figs).

Certain	foods,	such	as	the	spices	cinnamon	and	nutmeg,	are	thought	of	as	“warming”	foods,	so	their
addition	to	dishes	is	thought	to	add	a	warming	quality	that	might	be	especially	welcomed	on	a	cold	day.
There	are	also	“cooling”	foods	(such	as	cucumber	and	mint)	that	can	be	used	just	as	judiciously.

Keeping	an	ingredient’s	function	in	mind	will	help	you	use	it	most	wisely,	and	avoid	unfortunate
mismatches	of	flavor	and	function.	We	still	remember	an	otherwise	delicious	beet	salad	we	were	once
served	as	an	appetizer	in	New	Orleans	that	was	so	sweet	it	killed	our	appetite	for	the	rest	of	our	meal.

Region

Determining	the	region	that	will	serve	as	the	reference	point	for	whatever	you’re	cooking	is	one	of	the
easiest	ways	to	create	successful	flavor	marriages	in	the	kitchen.	Thinking	regionally	is	as	important	to
good	pairing	as	thinking	seasonally	is	to	good	cooking.	Many	people	are	familiar	with	the	maxim	“If	it
grows	together,	it	goes	together,”	and	this	is	still	the	best	place	to	start	as	a	guide.	Knowing	what	country
you	want	to	draw	on	will	narrow	your	list	of	ingredient	choices,	often	for	the	better!	For	example,	as
chicken	is	the	world	traveler	of	ingredients,	if	you’re	making	a	chicken	dish,	you’ll	especially	need	to
decide	on	a	region	of	inspiration.	Are	you	going	to	root	your	dish	in	Mexico	by	topping	it	with	salsa,	or
take	it	to	France	by	finishing	it	with	a	mustard	cream	sauce?	The	accompaniments	you	choose	will
reinforce	the	dish’s	sense	of	place.	Would	rice	and	beans,	or	boiled	new	potatoes,	be	most	appealing
served	alongside	it?

Flavor	Affinities

A	perfect	ingredient	served	plainly	can	be	an	extraordinary	thing,	whether	a	perfectly	ripe	and	sweet
piece	of	fruit,	or	a	silky	slice	of	raw	fish	as	sashimi.	But	in	the	real	world,	perfect	ingredients	are	all	too
rare	—	and	there	are	few	ingredients	whose	flavors	can’t	be	helped	along	by	a	pinch	of	this	or	a	splash	of
that.	A	sprinkle	of	sugar	will	bring	out	the	flavor	of	strawberries.	A	squeeze	of	lime	will	bring	out	a
melon’s	sweetness.	A	drizzle	of	vinegar	will	provide	a	tasty	counterpoint	for	salty	French	fries.

Understanding	what	herbs,	spices,	and	other	seasonings	will	best	bring	out	the	flavor	of	whatever	it	is

you’re	cooking	is	some	of	the	most	important	knowledge	any	cook	can	master.	The	pages	that	follow
emphasize	modern-day	flavor	affinities	that	have	been	proved	in	some	of	the	best-respected	kitchens	in
this	country	in	this	millennium.

Studying	the	language	and	syntax	of	ingredients	in	these	pages	will	allow	you	access	to	the	collective
wisdom	—	and	impeccably	sound	judgment	—	of	some	of	America’s	most	imaginative	chefs.



Chapter	3

FLAVOR	MATCHMAKING:	THE	CHARTS

Good	cooking	does	not	depend	on	whether	the	dish	islarge	or	small,	expensive	or	economical.	If	one
has	the	art,	then	a	piece	of	celery	or	salted	cabbage	can	be	made	intoa	marvelous	delicacy;	whereas	if
one	has	not	the	art,	all	the	greatest	delicacies	and	rarities	of	land,	sea	or	sky	areof	no	avail.

—YUAN	MEI,	EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY	CHINESE	POET

When	you’re	creating	in	the	kitchen,	the	starting	point	for	a	dish	or	a	menu	can	be	literally	anything.	It	can
begin	with	the	seasonal	availability	of	a	particular	ingredient	—	vegetable,	fruit,	meat,	or	seafood	—	or


even	a	cooking	style,	such	as	grilling	in	the	summer	or	braising	in	the	winter.	It	can	begin	with	a	craving
for	the	flavors	of	a	particular	country	or	region:	the	garlic	and	herbs	of	Provence,	or	the	garlic	and	ginger
of	Asia.	Or	it	can	begin	with	simple	curiosity,	the	urge	to	experiment	with	a	new	ingredient	or	technique.
Recognizing	this,	we’ve	provided	a	similarly	broad	range	of	starting	points	in	the	A-to-Z	(achiote

seeds	to	zucchini	blossoms)	lists	that	follow:	the	seasons	(with	listings	for	autumn,	spring,	summer,	and
winter);	an	extensive	variety	of	vegetables,	fruits,	meat,	seafood,	and	other	ingredients;	dozens	of	world
cuisines;	and	a	broad	array	of	flavorings	and	seasonings	(from	avocado	oil	to	fennel	pollen	to	Kaffir
lime),	including	dozens	of	different	salts,	peppers,	herbs,	spices,	oils,	and	vinegars.

Below	each,	we’ve	distilled	and	summarized	key	aspects	of	an	ingredient’s	essence:	its	season,	taste,

weight,	volume,	and	primary	function.	You’ll	also	find	its	most	recommended	cooking	techniques	and
some	useful	tips	to	keep	in	mind	when	working	with	it.	After	all,	some	ingredients	lend	themselves	to
being	prepared	in	a	particular	manner:	While	chicken	is	versatile	enough	to	be	cooked	in	a	number	of
ways,	delicate	fish	beg	to	be	served	lightly	cooked	or	even	raw,	while	tougher	cuts	of	meat	beg	to	be
braised	or	stewed.

When	perusing	the	listings	of	compatible	flavors,	readers	of	our	book	What	to	Drink	with	What	You
Eat	will	recognize	our	ranking	system	to	let	you	know	which	pairings	are	truly	stellar.	Those	ingredients
that	appear	in	BOLD	CAPS	with	an	asterisk	(*)	are	ethereal,	time-honored	classics:	these	“marriages
made	in	heaven”	comprise	the	top	1	or	2	percent	of	pairings.	Next	we	have	very	highly	recommended
pairings	in	BOLD	CAPS.	Bold,	noncapitalized	listings	are	frequently	recommended	pairings;	and	plain
text	pairings	are	recommended	pairings.	But	remember:	Even	when	just	a	single	top	expert	recommends	a
flavor	combination,	it’s	very	high	praise	indeed.

In	some	cases,	we’ve	also	noted	flavor	pairings	to	AVOID	or	steer	clear	of,	to	prevent	overpowering

or	clashing	with	your	star	ingredient.

For	many	listings,	we’ve	also	indicated	“flavor	trios”	and	other	“flavor	cliques”	to	get	you	started	on

compound	flavor	combinations.	In	other	cases,	you’ll	find	some	of	America’s	most	creative	chefs’
signature	dishes,	so	you	can	gain	inspiration	from	some	of	the	most	celebrated	restaurant	kitchens	across
the	country.

Throughout	these	pages,	you’ll	also	find	several	insightful	sidebars	on	cooking	with	herbs,

mushrooms,	pastas,	steaks,	and	more.	They’ll	serve	to	help	you	learn	not	only	the	“whats”	of	combining
flavors,	but	also	the	“whys”	and	“hows.”

Keep	an	eye	out	for	the	distinctions	being	made	among	ingredients.	After	all,	not	even	all	salts	are
created	equal.	As	you	hone	your	selections,	you’ll	hone	the	quality	of	the	flavors	you’re	able	to	create.
Since	the	turn	of	the	new	millennium,	we	have	traveled	throughout	the	United	States	and	Canada,
spending	thousands	of	hours	interviewing	dozens	of	the	most	creative	chefs	and	other	experts	on	their
most	recommended	flavor	pairings.	We’ve	scoured	these	experts’	memories	—	along	with	their	post-1999
restaurant	menus,	Web	sites,	cookbooks,	and	other	highly	recommended	books	—	for	pairing	insights.
Then	we	synthesized	their	advice	into	the	comprehensive,	easy-to-use	listings	that	follow.	These	listings
represent	a	treasure	trove	of	pairing	ideas	for	you	to	put	to	work	in	your	own	kitchen.

Armed	with	the	extensive	information	that	follows,	you’ll	learn	how	to	better	show	off	virtually	any
ingredient,	or	to	recreate	the	flavors	of	any	world	cuisine,	you	can	think	of.	From	here	on	out,	you’ll	have
the	expert	advice	of	some	of	America’s	most	imaginative	culinarians	at	your	disposal	when	you	want	to
inspire	your	own	creativity.	Whether	you’re	exploring	a	new-to-you	ingredient	or	looking	for	additional
ideas	for	working	with	an	ingredient	you’ve	cooked	a	thousand	times,	you’ll	find	insightful	tips	and	a
plethora	of	pairings	here.

Almonds	are	fairly	versatile	in	that	their	flavor	is	not	very	specific.	When	they	are	manufactured,	then
they	have	a	distinct	flavor:	think	of	Frangelico,	almond	oil,	or	marzipan	in	dessert.	In	these	cases,	the
almond	has	a	very	distinct	flavor.

No	country	in	the	world	has	anchovies	like	Spain.	They	are	sophisticated,	and	the	ones	from	the	north	of

As	a	kid,	I	hated	black	jelly	beans.	But	I	have	grown	to	like	all	the	various	forms	of	anise,	and	star	anise
is	one	of	my	favorites.	My	favorite	application	is	when	it	is	infused	with	milk	chocolate.	It	then	has	an
almost	malty-caramely	quality	to	it.	It	adds	that	little	something	that	people	can’t	quite	identify.	I	also	love
pears	with	anise,	which	works	well	with	roasted	or	poached	pears.

The	combination	of	apple	and	celery	works.	A	tart	green	apple	sorbet	is	not	going	to	knock	your	socks
off,	because	you	are	programmed	to	know	it.	When	you	add	the	flavor	of	celery,	you	get	something	new.	I
also	love	the	flavors	of	apple	and	fennel	together,	especially	in	sorbet.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	make	an	apple	confit	of	thinly	sliced	apples	with	cinnamon	caramel	powder	layered	between	the	apples
and	baked	slowly.	When	the	dish	is	served,	next	to	the	apples	is	a	small	pile	of	dates	poached	in	syrup
with	vanilla.	The	other	flavors	on	the	plate	are	lemon	confit,	quince,	raw	apple	with	apple	cider	gelée,
and	ras	el	hanout	(a	Moroccan	spice	blend).

For	this	dish	you	need	a	contrast	for	the	sweetness,	so	the	role	of	the	lemon	confit	is	to	cleanse	and

refresh.	If	the	confit	was	not	there,	you	would	have	a	bite	of	the	sweet	date	and	be	done.	The	date	and
lemon	is	like	a	salad.	The	line	drawing	this	together	is	the	quince	and	dates	that	come	from	the	Middle
East	and	that	was	the	line	to	ras	el	hanout.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

If	you	cook	apples	on	top	of	the	stove,	some	varieties	will	have	a	lot	of	juice	while	others	will	have	none
at	all.	Fuji,	Gala,	and	Golden	Delicious	apples	tend	to	be	juicy,	while	Granny	Smith	apples	are	often
drier.	With	different	types	of	apples,	you	often	don’t	know	exactly	what	they	will	do.	So	if	I’m	going	to
serve	apples	with	gingerbread,	I	will	sauté	them	in	a	little	sugar	and	see	what	happens.	If	they	are	letting
out	a	bunch	of	juice,	I	won’t	add	much	sugar.	If	they	are	dry,	I’ll	add	some	apple	juice	or	Calvados.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

When	I	make	an	apple	pie,	I	won’t	use	any	fewer	than	three	different	kinds	of	apples	for	their	different
textures	and	sweetnesses,	which	ensures	that	every	single	bite	is	interesting.	I’ll	use	Galas	or	Golden
Delicious	apples	for	their	sweetness	in	the	middle	of	the	pie,	and	soft	Jonathans	or	McIntoshes	on	top	for
their	ability	to	melt	into	the	others,	and	Braeburns	or	Granny	Smiths	on	the	bottom	for	their	ability	to	stay
firm.	.	.	.	I	can’t	imagine	an	apple	pie	without	cinnamon,	a	splash	of	lemon	juice,	and	a	pinch	of	salt.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

Apples	and	caramel	are	a	wonderful	combination	and	depending	on	what	nut	you	add	it	will	take	the
combination	in	very	different	directions.	If	you	add	pecans,	it	would	make	the	combination	a	heavier
winter	dessert,	versus	adding	almonds,	which	would	keep	it	lighter.	Both	work;	you	just	need	to	decide
how	heavy	you	want	the	dish.

Apple	and	shiso	work	well	together.	I	especially	like	them	together	in	a	sorbet.	I	will	use	a	Granny	Smith
apple	that	has	a	nice	tartness	combined	with	a	little	sugar,	lemon,	and	then	the	shiso.	The	shiso	has	a
cumin	and	cinnamon	flavor	that	is	a	natural	with	apple.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

If	you	stay	in	the	boundaries	of	what	people	think	a	dessert	should	be	it	gets	very	hard	to	do	something
new.	We	explain	that	they	already	eat	carrot	cake.	We	think	parsnip	will	work	instead	of	carrot	and	that
kabocha	squash	will	work	instead	of	pumpkin	in	a	pie.

When	people	see	eggplant	in	a	dessert	they	automatically	think	it	will	not	work.	You	have	to	hide	the

unusual	element	and	play	up	what	people	know	already.	The	boundaries	are	limitless	when	you	think	of
all	the	crossovers	between	sweet	and	savory.	Duck	à	l’orange	is	a	fruit	and	meat	combined,	so	why	not
use	bacon	in	a	dessert?	A	pancake	with	maple	syrup	and	bacon	on	the	plate	is	really	sweet	and	savory.	So
people	already	eat	these	combinations	unconsciously.

For	our	apple-eggplant	dessert,	we	start	with	a	choux	dough	piecrust.	Then	we	layer	an	almond
cream-like	custard.	Then	we	alternate	apple	and	eggplant	slices	side	by	side.	We	use	baby	eggplant
because	it	has	a	spongy	texture	and	sucks	up	moisture	from	the	cream	that	can	otherwise	make	the	crust
soggy	and	absorb	the	juice	and	flavor	from	the	apples	that	would	normally	just	evaporate.	So	when	you
eat	the	eggplant	and	apples,	the	eggplant	tastes	like	apples.
—	DOMINIQUE	AND	CINDY	DUBY,	WILD	SWEETS	(VANCOUVER)

I	have	always	been	very	fond	of	chef	Frédy	Girardet	[who	earned	three	Michelin	stars	at	his	restaurant	in
Switzerland	before	retiring	in	1996].	When	I	was	young,	I	cooked	almost	every	recipe	from	his	book	and
visited	his	restaurant.	One	of	his	most	interesting	desserts	was	an	apple	dessert	made	of	apples	in	the
shape	of	little	balls.	The	dessert	broke	away	from	cooking	apples	whole	in	the	traditional	way,	which
alone	inspired	me.	He	cooked	them	over	a	very	high	heat	for	two	minutes	and	put	them	into	a	red	wine
reduction	that	had	cinnamon,	orange	peel,	and	sugar.	This	was	put	onto	a	sheet	tray	that	needed	to	be
shaken	for	an	hour	so	the	apples	would	not	dry	out.	The	apples	would	absorb	these	flavors	like	a	sponge
and	would	then	be	served	with	vanilla	ice	cream.

In	that	spirit,	we	transformed	this	dessert.	We	transformed	the	wine	by	“espherication”	so	that	it
creates	a	bubble	of	liquid	that	explodes	in	your	mouth.	We	cut	apples	with	a	melon	baller,	then	vacuum-
packed	the	apples	with	the	wine	but	cooked	it	in	such	a	way	that	the	apples	stayed	hard	and	absorbed	the
wine	flavor.

We	serve	a	dish	of	smoked	oysters	with	apples.	We	smoke	the	oysters	over	applewood,	and	so	it	seemed
logical	to	add	apple	to	the	dish.	We	serve	it	with	a	puree	of	apple	with	juniper	that	just	plays	beautifully
off	the	oyster.

—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)


Apricot	is	a	fruit	you	need	to	cook	to	help	unleash	its	flavors.	A	bite	of	raw	apricot	is	kind	of	bland	and
doesn’t	excite	very	much.	If	you	throw	that	same	apricot	into	the	oven	and	heat	it	up	a	bit,	it	turns	into	a
whole	different	fruit.	Apricot	with	vanilla	is	a	match	made	in	heaven.

cavity.	The	homemade	mayonnaise	I	serve	is	made	with	eggs	and	just	a	little	olive	oil	but	mostly	melted
butter,	which	makes	it	richer	and	more	flavorful	—	which	is	based	on	how	it	is	made	for	the	Chinese	dish

Daniel	Humm	of	New	York’s	Eleven	Madison	Park	on
Making	Asparagus	Soup
Making	and	seasoning	soup	is	one	of	the	best	ways	to	learn	about	flavor.	Let’s	make
asparagus	soup:


•	You	need	a	lot	of	asparagus	flavor.
•	You	need	acidity.
•	You	need	sweetness	that	will	come	from	the	asparagus.
•	You	need	the	right	amount	of	salt.
•	You	need	just	the	right	amount	of	spice,	so	that	it	doesn’t	actually	taste	spicy.	We	use	a	lot	of

cayenne,	but	you	would	never	know	it	is	there;	it	is	just	an	accent.

•	You	need	fresh	lime	juice	to	finish.

Soup	is	a	play	of	balance	when	you	have	a	lot	of	flavor.	You	can	add	a	lot	of	salt	and	it	won’t	taste	salty.
You	can	add	a	lot	of	acid	and	it	won’t	taste	acidic.	But	you	still	have	a	bold-flavored	soup.	It’s	like
winemaking;	at	some	point,	there	is	a	balance	of	all	the	flavors.

The	first	thing	you	need	to	do	is	get	all	the	asparagus	flavor	into	the	soup	at	the	start.	We	save	our

asparagus	liquid	from	all	the	asparagus	we	cook	to	use	for	asparagus	stock.

Making	the	soup:	We	sweat	the	asparagus	[that	is,	cook	it	over	low	heat	in	a	little	fat,	generally	in	a
covered	pot	or	pan]	very	slowly.	When	we	add	wine,	we	do	it	multiple	times,	adding	a	little	at	a	time	and
reducing	it,	then	repeating	the	process.	What	this	does	is	concentrate	the	flavor	at	each	step.	It	makes	a	big
difference	[before	adding	the	asparagus	liquid].

Finishing	the	soup:	A	soup	may	taste	seasoned,	but	it	still	needs	to	be	“woken	up.”	You	taste	the
asparagus,	but	maybe	it	doesn’t	blow	you	away	at	first.	To	do	that,	you	need	acid	and	cayenne.	We	season
the	soup	with	lime	because	it	is	a	stronger	acid	and	yet	has	less	flavor	than	lemon.	If	I	use	lemon	to	geas
much	acid	as	I	need	for	the	soup,	I	will	need	to	use	so	much	that	the	soup	will	taste	lemony	instead.

—	HIRO	SONE	AND	LISSA	DOUMANI,	TERRA	(ST.	HELENA,	CALIFORNIA)


In	the	autumn,	I	use	walnut	vinegar,	which	is	red	wine	vinegar	with	macerated	walnuts	in	it.	It	is	great	on
a	dish	of	sweetbreads	and	hazelnuts.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	I	think	of	autumn,	I	think	of	apples,	pears,	quince	—	which	is	so	underrated	—	figs,	and	pumpkins.
I	work	with	apples	and	pears,	which	you	can	start	using	in	September,	especially	with	the	early
apples	like	Gravenstein	in	the	Bay	Area.	I	try	not	to	use	pumpkin	until	close	to	Halloween,	because	no
matter	what	you	do	with	it,	it	will	still	taste	like	pumpkin.	It’s	not	like	berries	or	apples	that	you	can	do	a
thousand	things	with.	As	a	pastry	chef,	if	I	serve	pumpkin	too	soon,	people	will	get	sick	of	it	—	and	if	I
take	it	off	the	menu,	there	is	nothing	to	replace	it	with.	So	I	try	to	wait	so	I	don’t	peak	too	early.

Figs	are	great	for	fall.	The	problem	with	figs	is	that	there	are	not	that	many	fig	lovers	out	there.	There
are	a	lot	more	peach,	chocolate,	and	apple	lovers	than	there	are	fig	lovers.	When	I	make	a	fig	dessert,	I’ll
pair	it	with	a	raspberry	or	late	summer	fruit	so	it’s	more	likely	to	meet	with	customer	acceptance.

In	the	fall,	I’ll	make	more	cakes.	Fall	also	turns	into	caramel	season,	and	fall	fruits	work	so	well	with

caramel.	I	keep	a	lighter	hand	with	caramel	in	the	fall	because	it	is	being	combined	with	fruit	versus
chocolate.

Bacon	can	be	salt,	fat,	and/or	smoke,	depending	on	the	bacon	you	choose.	You	can	also	play	with	its
texture,	depending	on	whether	you	are	using	pork	belly	or	crispy	bacon.	It	is	wonderful	with	vegetables.
The	fat	is	delicious,	so	if	you	are	braising	onions	in	bacon	fat,	reduce	that	down,	and	add	a	little	onion	jus
and	vinegar,	you	have	a	great	sauce.	Bacon	just	brings	another	layer	of	flavor	to	the	vegetables.	My	dish
of	Berkshire	pork	chop	with	scarlet	turnips,	roasted	rhubarb,	and	smoked	bacon	with	cherry-almond	salsa
seca	represents	the	relationship	between	fat,	salt,	sugar,	and	acid;	they	are	all	there.	The	bacon	brings
complexity	to	the	pork;	the	cherry	brings	acid	balance;	and	the	almond	brings	a	different	kind	of	fat	with
crunch.	The	almonds	in	the	dish	are	marcona,	and	every	tenth	one	is	extremely	bitter,	which	adds	another
layer	of	complexity.

—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	hate	overripe	bananas.	We’ll	actually	freeze	whole,	unpeeled	bananas,	which	will	continue	to	ripen	in
the	freezer	and	turn	black.	When	we	want	bananas	to	use	as	a	puree,	we’ll	pull	them	out	and	let	them	thaw
before	pureeing,	and	then	add	them	to	a	cake	or	mousse.	The	flavor	is	much	better	this	way.
—	DOMINIQUE	DUBY,	WILD	SWEETS	(VANCOUVER)

I	serve	a	banana	crème	brûlée	that	is	not	made	in	ramekins	(the	usual	individual	serving	cups)	but	cut	out
of	a	sheet	pan	and	caramelized.	I	serve	this	set	up	in	a	grid	with	two	squares	of	crème	brûlée,	one	topped
with	a	little	citrus,	the	other	with	caramelized	bananas	—	alternated	with	citrus	biscuit,	one	topped	with	a
brown	butter	ice	cream,	and	the	other	with	caramelized	banana.	So	I	have	these	three	flavors	—	banana,
citrus,	and	brown	butter	—	tied	together	with	a	salted	peanut–caramel	sauce.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

A	banana’s	ripeness	will	determine	what	you	do	with	it.	I	like	my	bananas	yellow	and	firm.	If	you	are
going	to	make	a	bananas	Foster	and	your	bananas	are	very	yellow,	you	can	cook	them	longer	and	they
won’t	fall	apart	or	turn	to	mush.	If	you	start	with	a	banana	that	is	pretty	brown,	the	second	you	add	heat,	it
falls	apart.	A	brown	banana	gives	me	shivers!

I	use	basil	a	lot.	I	will	add	it	at	the	very	end	of	cooking	a	dish,	and	it	will	totally	change	where	thdish	is
going.	Added	at	the	last	second,	it	gives	a	minty	freshness	that	was	not	there	before.	Basil	says	“fresh”
and	“alive”	to	me.	And	although	you	can	get	it	year-round,	I	associate	it	with	summer.

I	think	particularly	of	fish	and	shellfish	with	basil.	I	cook	a	lobster	with	a	sauce	of	sweet	Muscat	or

Sauternes,	curry,	and	lime.	This	is	a	dish	that	has	been	played	with.	The	shells	have	been	chopped	up,
added	to	mirepoix,	and	turned	into	sauce.	Then	there’s	wine.	So	when	the	basil	hits,	you	have	this	whole
new	thing	going	on.	It	opens	up	the	dish	and	makes	it	light.	It	goes	against	the	“worked-on”	aspect	of	the
dish.

In	Thai	cooking,	you	will	find	coconut	milk–based	curry	that	will	have	whole	leaves	of	basil	in	it.

Basil	becomes	something	of	a	vegetable	served	this	way.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	basil	in	syrups.	It	works	with	strawberries	and	any	citrus	fruit.	The	trio	I	use	the	most	for	summer
fruits	like	berries	is	basil,	lemon,	and	vanilla.	I	have	even	macerated	cherry	tomatoes	in	this	combination
and	made	them	into	a	fruit	crisp.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	basil.	It	is	more	familiar	than	cilantro,	and	more	people	like	it.	I	use	it	in	ceviche	instead	of	cilantro
because	it	is	not	as	pungent.	I	combine	hamachi	tuna	with	tomato,	watermelon,	yuzu,	and	sesame	seeds
with	fresh	basil	and	basil	oil.

I	am	a	little	too	fond	of	bay	leaf.	I	use	it	a	lot.	I	probably	have	a	fondness	for	it	because	I	associate	it	with
so	many	childhood	flavors,	like	pot	roast.	It	has	a	hearty	quality	to	it	and	I	associate	it	with	stocks	anbig
flavors.	I	will	use	fresh	or	dried	bay	leaf.	Fresh	bay	leaf	has	fresher	flavor	and	is	surprisingly	more
intense	than	dried	bay	leaf,	but	it’s	still	not	as	dramatic	a	difference	as	you	can	find	with	other	herbs	when
it	comes	to	fresh	versus	dried.

explain	they	only	need	two	or	three	at	the	most.

Fava	beans	have	a	great	flavor.	Cooks	in	the	past	would	blanch	them,	and	the	flavor	would	be	left	in	the
water.	Today,	what	I	like	to	do	with	favas	and	other	vegetables	is	to	put	them	in	a	pan	with	a	little	water,
olive	oil,	or	butter,	and	to	cover	them	while	they	cook.	That	way,	all	the	flavor	stays	in	the	vegetables.	If	I
could	cook	for	my	customers	the	way	I	like	to	cook	and	eat	at	home,	I	would	sweat	some	spring	onions	in
a	pan	with	butter	or	oil,	covered,	to	keep	in	the	flavor.	Then	I’d	add	the	shucked	fava	beans	and	let	them
cook	with	a	little	water.	At	the	last	second,	I’d	toss	in	some	chopped	parsley	or	basil,	and	there’s	your
sauce.	This	would	be	great	under	some	fish.	If	you	added	some	thyme	and	maybe	a	little	lamb	jus,	it
would	also	work	with	lamb.
—	TRACI	DES	JARDINS,	JARDINIÈRE	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Fava	beans	have	a	very	delicate	flavor,	I	like	them	raw	and	tender	by	themselves	—	or	combined	with
sheep’s	milk	cheese	and	olive	oil.	However,	I	wouldn’t	use	an	olive	oil	that’s	too	peppery	or	spicy,
because	it	would	overwhelm	them.

I	love	blue	cheese	with	beef.	We	make	a	dish	with	blue	cheese	sauce	that	has	chicken	stock,	Dijon
mustard,	truffle	juice,	and	fresh	truffle.	This	is	a	sauce	that	has	many	layers	of	flavor.	The	mustard	is
barely	there	but	adds	much	more	flavor	to	the	sauce	than	vinegar	or	lemon	would.	The	sauce	is	served	on
a	[beef]	filet	that	has	been	poached	in	spiced	red	wine.	The	poaching	liquid	is	made	with	Cabernet
Sauvignon	that	has	been	reduced	for	25	minutes	to	concentrate	its	flavor,	juniper	berries,	pepper,	star
anise,	fennel	seeds,	and	cloves.	The	cooked	tannin	in	the	wine	really	brings	up	the	meaty	flavor	of	the
beef.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

All	cuts	of	beef	have	a	different	flavor	profile:	There	is	the	big	beefy	flavor	of	the	strip	steak,	the
luxurious	tenderness	of	filet	mignon,	and	the	juicy,	fatty	mouthfeel	of	a	great	rib	eye.	Skirt	steak	is	a	juicy
cut	that	is	great	served	as	an	open-faced	sandwich.	Hanger	steak	has	an	offal	quality	to	it	and	is	different
from	all	the	others.	Braised	short	ribs	pick	up	all	of	the	flavors	of	what	they	are	cooked	with,	developing
layers	of	deep,	dark	beef	flavor	after	being	cooked	on	the	bone	for	hours.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)


We	make	a	wood-grilled	18-ounce	“prime”	rib	eye	of	beef	with	a	gratin	of	macaroni	and	goat	cheese,
glazed	shallots,	oxtail	red	wine	sauce,	and	fleur	de	sel.	This	dish	is	meat	on	meat	on	meat!	We	have	the
steak,	oxtail	sauce,	and	shallots	braised	in	veal	stock.	This	dish	has	so	much	flavor.	You	have	the	richness
and	fattiness	of	the	rib	eye,	and	we	grill	it	over	a	wood	fire	that	takes	it	to	a	whole	other	place.	Toit
with	a	drizzle	of	olive	oil,	the	fleur	de	sel,	cracked	pepper,	and	then	add	rich	oxtail	sauce	to	it.	People	go

You	can	braise	brisket	for	hours,	and	it	still	tastes	like	brisket,	making	it	ideal	to	prepare	for	large
parties.	Nothing	is	better	than	what	the	Texans	do	with	brisket,	and	that	is	barbecue.	I	also	noticed	that
Texans	get	the	fattiest	brisket	I	have	ever	seen,	so	the	fat	just	melts	away	and	the	meat	is	self-basting.	My
favorite	barbecued	brisket	is	from	Mueller’s	outside	of	Austin.	He	cooks	it	about	twenty	hours	and	then
wraps	it	in	brown	butcher	paper	to	let	it	rest	—	which	I	think	is	the	key	to	his	barbecue.

BEEF	—	SHORT	LOIN

This	is	the	T-bone	steak.	When	it	is	cut	double	cut	[that	is,	twice	as	thick],	that	is	when	it	is	a	porterhouse.
The	story	goes	that	it	was	first	served	in	Lower	Manhattan	in	1815	at	a	porter	house.	The	owner	ran	out	of
his	usual	cut	of	meat,	and	when	a	customer	asked	for	something	to	go	with	his	porter	[beer],	the	owner	cut
him	this	huge	piece	of	meat.	It	became	known	as	a	“porterhouse”	steak.	The	porterhouse	steak	is	part	filet
mignon	and	part	strip	steak.	It	is	the	perfect	grilling	steak.	You	get	the	tenderness	of	the	filet,	and	the	big
beefy	chewiness	of	the	strip	steak.

Vikram	Vij	of	Vancouver’s	Vij’s	on	Beef	Short	Ribs	in
Cinnamon
For	braising,	I	prefer	to	use	cinnamon	bark.	Cinnamon	stick	is	pretty,	but	it	is	steamed	and
rolled	and	a	little	too	manipulated.	In	this	dish,	cinnamon	bark	is	big	and	intense	and	not
needed	for	presentation.	At	the	end	of	the	braise,	you	pull	it	out	and	throw	it	away.	This
dish	is	cooked	for	four	hours	and	the	cinnamon	flavor	does	not	cook	out.	In	the	end,	the
cinnamon	imparts	a	delicate,	sweet,	aromatic	flavor.	It	adds	contrast	to	the	chile	flavor	from
the	curry.	If	this	dish	ever	has	too	much	cinnamon	flavor,	you	can	counterbalance	it	with	rice
or	yogurt	that	has	a	little	salt	and	pepper	in	it.

—	Vikram	Vij	and	Meeru	Dhalwala,	Vij’s	(Vancouver)

Short	ribs	are	a	luxurious	cut	of	meat,	because	they	are	braised	for	three	to	three	and	a	half	hours.	We
don’t	braise	our	ribs	in	red	wine,	but	in	Yuengling	Porter,	which	has	ethereal	chocolate	notes	in	the
aroma.	In	the	sauce	with	the	beer	is	mirepoix,	a	sachet	of	herbs,	lots	of	peppercorns,	and	chiles.	I	went	to
a	charity	event	where	they	served	short	ribs	for	six	hundred	guests,	and	one	reason	it	worked	is	because	it
is	a	cut	that	allows	for	a	great	margin	of	error.	You	cook	it	until	it	is	well	done	and	falling-off-the-bone
tender.	Falling-off-the-bone	tender	is	one	of	the	appeals	of	a	braised	dish.	It	is	sensual.	Get	yourself	a
glass	of	good	spicy	Syrah	with	that	short	rib	dish	and	think	great	thoughts!

BEEF	—	STEAK:	CHUCK

This	cut	is	really	beefy,	flavorful,	and	fatty,	but	tough.	Chuck	steak	can	be	grilled,	but	it	also	works	well
for	braising.	A	chuck	also	makes	a	good	cut	for	stew	because	it	has	nice	fat.	When	I	was	growing	up,	a
“steak	Episole”	was	chuck	steak	that	had	good	fat,	was	seared	well,	and	then	cooked	slowly	with
tomatoes,	onions,	and	fresh	oregano.	You	may	not	see	chuck	steak	a	lot	on	menus,	but	you	see	it	a	lot	in

Filet	mignon	gets	no	respect	from	many	chefs	because	it	doesn’t	have	much	beef	flavor,	but	it	is	still	the
most	popular	cut	in	restaurants.	I	like	to	sear	it	and	pan	roast	it	with	a	little	olive	oil	or	an	olive	oiand
butter	combination.	It	is	not	a	well-used	muscle	on	the	inside	of	the	short	loin,	so	filet	is	always	tender.
On	the	other	side	of	the	bone	from	the	more	worked	side	of	the	strip	steak	is	the	tail	end	of	the	filet.
Béarnaise	sauce	[i.e.,	vinegar,	shallots,	egg	yolks,	butter,	etc.]	is	a	classic	accompaniment	to	filet	mignon.

Skirt	steak	comes	in	a	long	strip	and	looks	like	a	belt	—	it’s	about	two	feet	long	and	a	couple	of	inches
wide.	This	is	an	incredibly	flavorful	cut	and	delicious.	It	is	very	reasonably	priced	as	well.	It	is	very
popular	in	the	Latin	community,	especially	with	Argentinians.	You	often	see	it	flattened	with	a	mallet	to
tenderize	it	[by	breaking	the	meat	fibers]	and	used	in	fajitas.	This,	along	with	the	hanger	steak,	is	the
beefiest	flavored	cut	of	beef.	We	serve	it	in	a	chimichurri	sauce,	which	is	a	classic	Argentinian	sauce
made	of	chopped	garlic,	onion,	and	parsley,	plus	white	[we	use	champagne]	vinegar,	red	pepper	flakes,

BEEF	—	STEAK	TARTARE

We	make	tartare	from	filet	mignon	and	hand-chop	it	to	order,	which	I	like	so	that	I	don’t	feel	like	I’m	just
eating	ground	beef.	I	season	our	tartare	with	mustard,	capers,	and	anchovies,	which	I	am	not	shy	about.
You	want	the	texture	of	the	beef	to	be	a	counterpoint.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Michael	Lomonaco	of	Porter	House	New	York	on	Cooking
Steak
Aging:	Aging	is	important	because	it	tenderizes	the	steak.	The	aging	process	breaks	down
the	fibers	and	dehydrates	the	steak,	concentrating	its	flavor.	A	dry-aged	steak	has	a	more
minerally	and	sharp	edge	to	it,	versus	fresh	meat	that	tastes	sweeter.	It	is	critical	to	the
flavor	and	adds	to	the	cost	because	it	takes	four	weeks	of	aging	to	achieve	it.

Seasoning:	All	our	steaks	are	seasoned	with	coarse	kosher	salt	and	freshly	ground
black	pepper	just	prior	to	cooking,	which	draws	out	the	flavor	while	they	cook.	A	squeeze	of
lemon	makes	a	good	Tuscan	steak	taste	even	better.	If	you	are	in	Italy	and	eating	“bistecca
Fiorentina,”	what	you	are	having	is	an	Italian	porterhouse.	The	steak	is	grilled	over	dried
grape	vines	and	served	with	a	drizzle	of	green	olive	oil	from	the	first	pressing	of	the	new
harvest	and	lemons	on	the	side.

Cooking:	A	steak	should	be	cooked	rare	to	medium	rare.	“Rare”	is	a	little	cool	inside
and	hot	on	the	exterior.	“Medium	rare”	is	just	a	shade	past,	and	only	warm	in	the	middle.
Cooking	a	steak	beyond	that	point,	it	starts	to	toughen	up	and	the	fat	oozes	out,	making	it
increasingly	dry	and	tough.

Saucing:	Part	of	looking	forward	is	looking	back.	Sauces	provide	the	connection	to
historical	French	and	Italian	cooking.	In	the	gastronomic	world,	the	saucier	was	the	top
cook	in	the	kitchen.	It	is	all	about	building	layer	upon	layer	of	complexity	in	a	sauce.	It	is
most	often	sweet	and	sour,	to	cut	through	the	richness	of	the	fat	of	the	steak.	Red	wine
sauce	has	the	acidity	to	cut	richness,	with	sweetness	from	caramelized	shallots,	and	it
enhances	the	beef	flavor.	We	also	make	a	homemade	barbecue	sauce	as	our	steak	sauce,
which	is	sweet	from	light	brown	sugar	and	molasses,	tart	from	red	wine	vinegar,	and	smoky
from	chipotle	peppers.

Hanger	steak	is	known	as	an	onglet	in	French	and	is	found	on	bistro	menus.	It	is	also	a	great	value,


which	is	why	you	see	it	on	menus	in	smaller	restaurants.	A	hanger	steak	is	incredibly	flavorful.	There	is
only	one	per	carcass,	and	it	comes	from	the	area	close	to	the	kidneys,	so	it	has	almost	an	offal	flavor	to
the	beef.	It	has	become	popular	because	it	is	different	and	not	a	typical-tasting	steak.	I	like	a	hanger	steak
grilled	and	served	rare	to	medium	rare.	Slicing	is	also	important,	because	you	have	to	cut	it	on	the	bias	so
that	it	is	tender.	I	like	a	hanger	steak	served	with	a	traditional	sauce,	such	as	a	caramelized	shallot	and	red
wine	sauce	or	a	bourbon	peppercorn	sauce.	It	is	important	to	caramelize	the	shallots	so	they	get	sweet	and
offset	the	gaminess	of	the	steak.	I	use	bourbon	instead	of	cognac	because	it	has	more	punch	to	it,	and	I’ll
use	four	different	peppercorns	—	white,	black,	pink,	and	green	—	with	the	last	two	modulating	the	flavor.
Green	peppercorns	have	the	sharpness	to	cut	through	the	richness.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Rib	steak	is	the	most	popular	cut	next	to	filet	mignon.	The	cut	comes	from	the	rib	roast,	where	one	end
meets	the	chuck	at	the	fattier	end	and	the	other	meets	the	short	loin	at	the	leaner	end.	The	rib	steak	that
meets	the	chuck	end	is	the	most	popular	and	can	even	have	a	big	knot	of	fat	in	it.	This	is	one	of	my
favorite	steaks.	A	big,	fatty,	juicy	rib	steak	can’t	be	beat	on	the	grill.	I	cook	these	bone-on	because	it	gives
more	beef	flavor.	We	do	a	Brandt	Ranch	cut	that	comes	from	California	just	north	of	Mexico.	That	area
has	lots	of	flavor	influences,	so	I	choose	to	do	a	chili	rub	on	the	steak.	The	cut	is	Holstein,	which	haa
sweeter	edge	to	its	meat.	We	grill	it	so	that	fat	melts	away	and	bastes	it	as	it	cooks.	At	the	end,	we	brush	it
with	a	blend	of	ancho	chili,	light	brown	sugar,	toasted	ground	cumin	seeds,	chipotle	chile,	and	a	pinch	of
cayenne.	Then	we	char	it	one	more	time,	so	that	is	like	reseasoning	the	meat.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

The	sirloin	is	a	good,	beefy-flavored	high-quality	cut.	It	is	a	cut	toward	the	back	of	the	animal	that	gets
more	work,	so	it	is	a	little	chewy,	but	it	is	a	good-quality	steak	for	barbecuing.	If	this	cut	is	quickly
cooked	over	high	heat	on	a	grill,	not	overcooked,	and	sliced	correctly	on	the	bias,	you	are	going	to	get	the
most	out	of	it.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	you	see	rare	roast	beef,	it	is	top	round.	It	is	a	little	tough,	and	that	is	why	you

see	roast	beef	always	sliced	so	thin.	Nothing	beats	top	round	for	a	good	old-fashioned
roast	beef	sandwich	because	it	doesn’t	have	any	gristle	or	fat	—	just	good,	beefy	flavor.
—	MICHAEL	LOMONACO,	PORTER	HOUSE	NEW	YORK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	I	was	in	Ireland,	I	swilled	Guinness	[stout]	and	ate	bangers	and	mash,	which	was	essentially
sausage	with	caramelized	onions	on	top.	It	was	so	good	that	when	I	came	back	to	the	U.S.,	I	started
experimenting	with	Guinness.	That’s	how	I	came	up	with	a	dish	of	braised	short	ribs	that	had	been
marinated	in	Guinness.	The	problem	you	often	have	cooking	with	beer	is	that	sometimes	the	dish	gets
bitter.	So,	to	counteract	that	naturally	without	using	sugar,	I	choose	to	use	onions.	I	marinate	the	ribs	in	the
beer,	then	braise	them,	and	finish	the	dish	with	a	puree	of	roasted	onions	for	balance.

People	love	fresh	beets.	Now	I	won’t	lay	claim	to	inventing	beet	salad	with	Gorgonzola	and	hazelnuts,
but	how	our	version	is	different	from	many	others	is	that	we	marinate	the	beets.	Overnight,	we’ll	marinate
peeled	beets	in	Barolo	vinegar,	shallots,	olive	oil,	salt,	and	pepper.	Using	Russian	and	Polish	cooking
principles,	marinating	the	beets	ensures	that	the	vinegar	is	able	to	penetrate	them	so	that	they	are	sure	to
be	tangy.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	wanted	to	take	beets	that	are	associated	with	winter	and	make	them	into	something	summery,	so	I	used
them	for	a	ceviche.	We	roasted	and	pureed	them	with	lime	and	froze	them	into	a	sorbet.	We	served	the
beet	sorbet	flat	in	a	bowl	so	it	looked	like	soup.	From	there,	we	layered	thinly	sliced	raw	bay	scallops


with	segments	of	lime,	cilantro,	and	red	onion	oil.	The	dish	is	very	fresh	tasting.	The	other	key	to	this	dish
was	that	we	had	all	the	flavors	of	ceviche	but	did	not	marinate	the	scallops	in	the	acid,	which	makes	them
rubbery.	The	scallops	treated	this	way	are	more	delicate,	like	sushi.

BITTER	DISHES	(e.g.,	greens,	barbecue	food)

Tips:	Salt	suppresses	bitterness.

BITTERNESS

Taste:	bitter
Function:	cooling;	stimulates	appetite;	promotes	other	tastes
Tips:	Bitterness	relieves	thirst.

When	a	bitter	component	is	added	to	a	dish,	it	creates	a	sense	of	lightness.
The	hotter	the	food	or	drink,	the	less	the	perception	of	bitterness.

So	many	Western	cultures	don’t	incorporate	bitterness	into	their	food.	In	India	and	Asia,	it	is	a
component	of	a	balanced	dish.	If	you	give	most	of	America	rice	with	lime	pickle,	they	will	not	be	thrilled.
It	will	be	too	sour,	bitter,	and	spicy.	To	introduce	the	bitter	flavor	of	lime	pickle,	we	will	puree	it	with
yogurt	and	use	it	for	a	marinade	for	whole	prawns.	That	way,	it	isn’t	overwhelming.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	used	to	love	dishes	that	were	rich	on	rich	—	but	the	older	I	get,	the	more	I	look	forward	to	that
bitterness,	the	cleansing	bite	that	makes	you	want	to	go	back	for	your	next	forkful	of	a	dish.	Almost	every
dish	in	our	kitchen	is	finished	with	some	kind	of	bitter	leaf	to	serve	as	a	balancing	component.	That’s	why
I	serve	cress	or	watercress	with	a	steak	and	potato	dish,	and	arugula	with	our	seared	bluefin	tuna	on
braised	veal	cheeks,	and	a	bed	of	bitter	greens	like	watercress,	frisée,	arugula,	and	shaved	endive	as	the
base	for	our	foie	gras	dish	—	to	cut	the	richness.

BRINED	DISHES

Taste:	salty
Tips:	Brining	meats	(i.e.,	in	salt	water)	before	cooking	increases	their	moistness,	juiciness,	and

I	don’t	brine	automatically.	If	I	have	a	chicken	that	I	know	will	cook	up	on	the	dry	side,	then	I	will	brine	it
first.	If	it	is	a	great	chicken	that	will	cook	up	naturally	juicy	and	doesn’t	need	help,	then	I	won’t.	You	can
make	a	pretty	strong	brine	for	squab	or	even	chicken	—	for	instance,	with	thyme	or	even	chile	pepper	—
and	the	meat	will	pick	up	some	flavors,	but	it’s	still	very	subtle.

BRUNCH

Customers	are	picky	at	brunch.	They	have	all	cooked	what	they	think	they	like,	they	think	they	can	do	it
slightly	better	than	we	can,	and	they	want	it	twice	as	fast.	So,	we	take	the	classics	like	pancakes	or	French
toast,	use	them	as	building	blocks,	and	push	them	a	little	further.

We	will	offer	seasonal	pancakes.	In	the	winter,	we’ll	make	buckwheat	pancakes	with	cinnamon	and

glazed	oranges.	Bridging	spring	into	summer,	we’ll	offer	corn	and	saffron	pancakes	with	a	spicy	poached
pear	and	fresh	ricotta.	Saffron	and	corn	work	really	well	together	because	of	the	floral	nature	of	the
saffron	and	sweetness	of	the	corn.	We	will	use	poached	pears	on	the	pancakes	until	switching	to
blueberries	for	the	summer,	which	give	a	real	pop.	The	pears	are	poached	in	a	red	wine	syrup	with
aleppo	chile	that	is	a	sun-dried	chile	with	a	rich,	round,	sweet	spice	to	it.	The	chile	is	not	noticeable,	but
it	acts	like	an	acid	by	lightening,	plus	cutting	the	sugar	and	richness	of,	the	pancake.

When	people	eat	pancakes,	they	naturally	reach	for	butter.	I	don’t	serve	butter	with	my	pancakes	and
instead	serve	fresh	ricotta.	We	use	ricotta	from	Anne	Saxelby,	who	supplies	us	with	a	fresh,	rich,	velvety
ricotta,	and	this	gives	a	richness	to	the	dish.

Butterscotch-Praline	Ice	Cream	Parfait
—	Rebecca	Charles,	Pearl	Oyster	Bar	(New	York	City)

One	of	my	favorite	flavors	in	the	world	is	brown	butter.	A	financier	cake	made	with	brown	butter	is	one
of	the	best	things	ever.	I	have	been	making	a	brown	butter	vinaigrette	for	a	jillion	years!	It	is	a	super-easy
pan	sauce	that	I	love	as	a	warm	sauce:	I	just	brown	my	butter	in	a	pan	until	it	gets	the	noisette	[brown]


color,	then	add	some	balsamic	vinegar.	It	doesn’t	even	need	to	be	expensive	balsamic.	You	make	an
emulsification	in	the	pan,	and	add	a	little	salt	and	pepper	and	it’s	done.	The	flavor	of	brown	butter,	salt,
and	acid	is	one	of	my	favorites.	It	works	well	on	different	fish	like	scallops	or	halibut	or	soft-shell	crabs.
—	TRACI	DES	JARDINS,	JARDINIÈRE	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Brown	butter	is	one	of	my	favorite	flavors,	and	it	pairs	well	with	anything	nutty,	as	well	as	richer	fruits
like	bananas.	A	classic	French	financier	is	hands-down	one	of	my	favorite	French	pastries	[a	cookie
made	with	brown	butter,	egg	whites,	flour,	and	powdered	sugar].

Butter	tastes	great	on	its	own,	and	in	making	brown	butter	you	are	not	adding	anything	to	it	—	just
transforming	it,	so	that	it	becomes	more.	The	process	is	simple	but	a	little	tricky,	as	it	keeps	cooking	even
after	it	is	off	the	stove.	Something	you	can	do	to	improve	it	is	—	halfway	through	the	cooking	process	—
start	whisking	the	butter,	because	it	intensifies	the	flavor	if	you	keep	the	particles	suspended.

Cabbage	often	has	the	connotation	of	being	heavy,	but	in	the	fall,	we’ll	make	a	fine	chiffonade	of	cabbage


that’s	very	light.	I	like	to	cut	cabbage	thin	and	roast	it	in	a	pan	so	that	the	edges	just	get	brown	because
that	tastes	really	good.	We	figured	that	out	by	mistake	by	putting	cabbage	into	too	hot	a	pan.	After	the	chef
raised	his	voice	about	how	that	is	the	wrong	way	to	cook	cabbage,	we	tasted	it,	and	it	was	good!	We	now
serve	a	green	cabbage	dish	cooked	this	way	with	caraway	seeds	and	walnuts,	then	deglazed	with
Calvados.	We	also	add	a	little	cider	vinegar	and	olive	oil	to	finish.	It	is	a	nice,	easy	marriage.	It	is	noan
unpredictable	marriage;	these	things	just	all	work	together.	We	pair	this	with	braised	pork	belly,	but	it
would	also	work	with	a	roasted	breast	of	squab	with	its	leg	done	in	a	confit.

Thumbelina	carrots	are	something	I	missed	when	I	moved	from	working	in	the	country	[i.e.,	Pocantico
Hills,	New	York,	where	Blue	Hill	at	Stone	Barns	is	located]	into	Manhattan.	Luckily,	I	recently	found
these	short,	fat	carrots	at	the	green	market.	We	sauté	these	carrots	over	an	open	fire	so	that	they	get	a	little
smoky.	When	they	are	cooked,	they	become	soft	and	creamy.	Once	cooked,	we	turn	them	into	a	puree	with
a	shot	of	carrot	juice	at	the	last	second.	We	pair	this	with	farro	that	has	been	cooked	like	risotto,	then	add
some	pine	nuts	and	more	Thumbelina	carrots	that	have	been	quartered.	I	don’t	know	what	is	more
seductive:	the	smooth	carrot	farro	with	its	light	carrot	flavor	or	the	carrots	themselves	that	are	totally
creamy.	The	dish	has	no	butter	or	cream	but	that	is	not	because	we	are	trying	to	be	healthy.	The	dish	just
doesn’t	need	it.
—	MICHAEL	ANTHONY,	GRAMERCY	TAVERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Juices	are	a	great	way	to	freshen	up	a	dish.	If	you	cook	a	carrot,	you	lose	the	“carrotiness”	of	it.	If	you
make	a	carrot	soup	with	cooked	carrots,	it	doesn’t	become	bright.	So	now	we	do	a	carrot	base	with


cooked	organic	carrots	with	tops,	onions,	garlic,	and	maybe	some	ginger	and	lemongrass.	With	that	base
we	make	a	really	thick	soup	and	then	add	carrot	juice	to	it.	In	the	end	you	have	fresh	and	cooked	carrots
for	a	better	flavor	profile.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	had	a	salad	at	a	restaurant	with	grated	carrots	and	tarragon	leaves	with	pistachios	—	and	I	knew	the
minute	I	tasted	it	that	I	could	adapt	this	salad	to	be	my	own.	Instead	of	grating	the	carrots,	I	cut	them	onthe
bias	and	roasted	them	with	a	little	ginger	and	juca	[an	African	mix	made	of	almonds,	pistachios,
hazelnuts,	and	spices].	To	finish	the	salad,	I	added	the	whole	tarragon	leaves,	great	pistachio	oil,	and	a
raita	of	yogurt	and	golden	raisins.	The	dish	has	wonderful	colors	and	texture	and	those	beautiful	whole
leaves	of	tarragon	which	I	had	never	thought	to	do	myself.
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

Carrots	—	which	pair	well	with	allspice,	cinnamon,	cloves,	and	cumin	—	are	one	of	the	few	vegetables
that	shine	in	desserts.	When	I	first	came	to	the	U.S.	I	discovered	carrot	cake	and	that	you	could	use	carrots
for	dessert.	I	have	since	made	carrot	ice	cream,	cookies,	and	fruit	paste.	The	problem	is	that	most	people
trust	carrot	cake	but	little	else.	When	I	am	using	carrots	for	dessert,	I	like	to	cook	them	with	orange.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Carrots	and	parsnips	are	similar,	and	I	like	the	depth	of	flavor	that	comes	from	combining	them.

he	used	them	together	in	a	soup.	I	didn’t	grow	up	liking	cauliflower,	but	I	do	now	when	it’s	well	roasted
or	pureed.	It	has	good	water	content,	which	makes	for	a	very	smooth	puree,	and	it	has	a	subtle	yet	distinct
flavor.	Apple	combines	well	with	both,	as	it	adds	acidity	and	crunch	while	cutting	the	stronger	flavors.

Of	all	vegetables,	celery	has	one	of	the	strongest	flavors.	To	me,	it	is	almost	like	a	truffle.	In	a	mirepoix,
you	need	all	the	vegetables	—	but	if	I	could	have	only	one,	it	would	be	celery.	I	love	its	earthy	flavor.
Celery	and	black	truffles	are	my	favorite	combination.	They	work	in	part	because	they	come	out	of	the
ground	at	the	same	time	of	year.	Any	root	vegetable	also	works	with	celery.	I	enjoy	celery	root	and	celery

Since	cheese	is	a	near-perfect	food,	I	sometimes	look	for	the	few	nutrients	missing	in	cheese	that	can	be
found	in	other	foods.	The	two	essential	nutrients	that	cheese	does	not	provide	are	vitamin	C	and	fiber.
This	recommends	fruits	especially	—	and	makes	a	great	start	to	the	day:	cheese,	some	high-fiber	vitamin
C–rich	fruit,	some	whole	grain	organic	bread,	and	coffee.	The	breads	I	prefer	with	cheese	are	usually
neutral	flavored,	though	I	fully	appreciate	the	nutty	or	herbed	or	fruity	breads	as	natural	partners	for
cheeses.	The	main	reason	I	prefer	neutral	flavors	in	my	breads	is	because	I	don’t	want	to	meddle	with	the
flavors	in	the	cheeses	themselves.	I’m	kind	of	a	purist	on	that!	Usually,	the	softer	the	cheese,	the	harder	the


bread	—	to	an	extent.	And	high-pectin,	high-fiber	fruits	[e.g.,	apples,	pears,	apricots,	plums,	nectarines,
peaches,	figs]	make	natural	accompaniments	for	many,	many	cheeses.

Which	cheeses?	My	faves	with	my	espresso	to	which	I	add	a	little	unfiltered	raw	honey	would	be	the
pressed	sheep	milk	cheeses:	Ossau	Iraty,	Roncal,	Zamorano,	Berkswell,	Spenwood,	Trade	Lake	Cedar,
Vermont	Shepherd,	manchego,	or	Pecorino	Foglie	Noce.	But	I’m	happy	with	whatever	is	looking	good,
and	preferably	the	harder	aged	cheeses:	sheep,	goat,	or	cow.
—	MAX	McCALMAN,	ARTISANAL	CHEESE	CENTER	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

With	aged	or	strong	cheese,	you	need	something	fruity	or	sweet	to	contrast	with	the	strong	flavor.
Pecorino	is	very	strong,	so	you	need	something	sweet	with	it.	With	an	aged	or	hard	cheese,	I	like	to	serve
some	chestnut	honey,	a	fruit	jam,	or	watermelon	confiture.	If	I	have	some	aged	goat	cheese,	I	like	a
mostarda	[Italian	mustard	fruit].	With	sharper	cheese,	I	also	like	a	nice	sweet	wine,	especially	an	Italian
Passito.	With	fresh	young	cheese,	I	simply	like	some	good	bread.	Chestnut	honey,	while	good	with	aged
cheese,	does	not	work	with	a	young	cheese.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Honey,	jam,	and	mostarda	go	great	with	cheese.	Most	honey	works	best	with	younger	cheeses	and	soft-
ripened	cheeses,	especially	if	they	have	a	chalky	quality	to	them.	I	love	mountain	Gorgonzola	with
chestnut	honey;	it	is	crazy!	In	Italy,	we	call	jam	a	confitura	or	marmalata.	I	like	it	with	saltier	cheeses
like	Parmesan,	or	with	more	assertive	cheeses.	Mostarda	is	made	of	fruits	cooked	in	a	white	wine
mustard	syrup	until	they	are	candied.	So,	you	have	a	sweet	candy	effect	with	the	spicy	mustard.	It	goes
with	any	savory	firm	cheese,	and	particularly	well	with	pecorino	and	Taleggio.

If	you	open	my	refrigerator	at	home,	you	will	always	find	a	piece	of	cheese!	I	love	many	cheeses,	but
there	will	definitely	be	a	piece	of	Parmigiano-Reggiano.	It	never	goes	bad	and	is	so	versatile.	I	can	cut	a
piece	off	to	go	with	a	glass	of	Prosecco	as	an	apéritif,	serve	it	after	dinner	with	red	wine,	slice	a	piece
for	a	sandwich,	or	grate	it	over	some	pasta.

Gina	DePalma	of	New	York’s	Babbo	on	Babbo’s	Cheese
Plate
At	Babbo,	I	oversee	the	cheese	selection,	which	has	seven	choices.	The	biggest	challenge
with	Italian	cheese	is	that	there	are	so	many	“superstars”	that	you	just	can’t	not	offer	them.
So,	in	the	seven	slots	we	have	many	standard	choices	but	they	are	amazing:

•	Parmigiano-Reggiano:	This	is	the	“undisputed	king	of	all	cheeses”	according	to	Mario	[Batali]!

•	Taleggio:	This	washed-rind	cheese	is	very	wet,	has	the	distinctive	orange	color,	and	is	gooey.	The
interior	is	sweet	and	the	rind	is	assertive.

•	Gorgonzola	Piccante:	This	is	firmer,	bluer,	nutty,	and	just	amazing!

•	Coach	Farm	Goat:	Though	it	is	not	from	Italy,	it	is	the	goat	cheese	we	choose.	[Mario	Batali’s
wife’s	family	owns	the	Coach	Farm	Dairy.]

•	Robiola:	This	is	a	soft-ripened	cheese	from	Piedmont.

•	Pecorino:	This	is	a	sheep’s	milk	cheese	that	is	nothing	like	the	Pecorino-Romano	that	you	get	in
your	deli	to	grate	over	pasta.	This	is	made	in	many	areas	around	Italy.	We	may	use	one	from	the	south
or	Tuscany	or	one	that	is	rubbed	with	tomato	or	aged	underground	from	another	part	of	the	country.
•	The	Seventh	Cheese:	I	play	around	with	the	seventh	cheese	and	change	it	often	but	a	recent
favorite	is	a	Piave,	which	is	like	an	English	Cheddar.	It	is	from	the	Veneto	along	the	Piave	River.

with	cherries.	Dark	chocolate	actually	goes	better	with	cherries	than	it	does	raspberries,	and	white
chocolate	works	with	cherries	as	well.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

If	you	have	perfect	ingredients	in	the	summertime,	you	don’t	have	to	do	much	to	them.	With	our	perfect
cherries	[Michigan,	while	at	Tribute	restaurant],	we	halved	them,	sprinkled	them	with	sugar,	and	heated
them	with	a	blowtorch	so	that	they	were	just	warmed	through.	The	slightly	caramelized	sugar	made	a	huge
difference	in	the	flavor.	I	used	a	goat	cream	cheese	worked	to	a	texture	similar	to	mascarpone	cheese,
which	I	shaped	into	quenelles.	Served	alongside	were	some	ice	wine	vinegar	caramel	sauce	and	a	crispy
crepe.	Before	serving,	I	added	individual	thyme	leaves	and	a	crack	of	black	pepper.	These	are	all	really


classic	flavors,	especially	the	cheese	with	black	pepper	and	cherries.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	was	reading	an	old	Fannie	Farmer	cookbook	from	the	late	1800s	about	making	cherry	jam.	In	the	recipe,
they	would	take	the	cherry	pits	and	crush	them.	I	thought	it	was	crazy	but	tried	it.	When	you	take	cherry
pits	and	crush	them,	it	gives	you	an	almond	flavor.	I	made	some	pickled	sour	cherries	with	the	crushed
pits	in	cheesecloth	with	the	pickling	liquid	and	I	got	this	great	almondy	flavor	that	went	deep	inside	the
cherries.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	like	to	let	them	shine	on	their	own.	But	I	do	really	like	cherries	and	grappa.	Mario	[Batali]	has	a	home
in	Michigan	and	he	brought	me	back	a	case	of	cherries.	They	were	so	perfect	I	just	macerated	them	in
grappa	and	torn	mint	leaves.	I	served	them	in	a	bowl	with	a	dollop	of	mascarpone.	Cherries	also	work
well	with	mint.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	loved	cherries	so	much	growing	up	that	I	would	climb	up	our	cherry	tree	and	eat	as	many	as	I	could.
Then	I	would	realize	I	didn’t	know	how	to	get	back	down	and	would	cry	until	the	neighbors	would	get	me
down.	I	still	love	cherries	and	especially	in	cherry	pie	or	a	clafoutis.	Cherries	work	well	with	vanilla	or
poached	in	red	wine,	but	I	like	to	keep	them	as	simple	as	possible.

—	Johnny	Iuzzini,	pastry	chef,	Jean	Georges	(New	York	City)

I	like	to	take	one	ingredient	and	see	how	much	I	can	do	with	it.	I	made	a	frozen	chestnut	semifreddowith
bits	of	candied	chestnuts.	This	was	then	set	on	an	orange-soaked	chestnut	sponge	cake,	next	to	a	chestnut
wafer	and	chestnut	paste.	I	needed	a	complementary	flavor,	and	I	have	always	liked	the	combination	of
pear	and	chestnut.	They	both	have	a	richness	but	depending	on	how	the	pear	is	handled,	it	can	add
freshness	and	acidity.	I	roasted	the	pear	in	sugar,	butter,	and	ice	wine	vinegar	and	finished	it	in	the	oven
until	soft.	The	pear	was	then	diced	tartare-like	and	had	orange	confit	added.	The	juices	from	the	pear
were	the	only	sauce.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Chestnuts	have	a	bursty	flavor	and	they	work	with	chocolate	and	pears.	You	have	to	combine	them	with
earthy	flavors.	If	you	paired	chestnuts	with	berries,	they	would	just	get	lost.

Red	beans	and	rice	with	andouille	sausage	is	my	favorite!	When	we	opened	up	after	the	hurricane
[Katrina]	and	were	serving	on	paper	plates,	I	made	a	roasted	Tabasco	chicken	served	with	dirty	rice,
with	the	sausage	stuffed	in	a	bell	pepper	alongside	red	bean	puree.	For	another	dish,	I	was	inspired	by	a
diner	down	the	street	from	us	that	had	chicken	and	waffles	on	the	menu,	which	is	an	old	Southern	dish.	My
take	is	to	make	a	savory	waffle	and	to	add	Boursin	cheese	with	lots	of	herbs.	Then	I	pair	it	with	chicken
thighs	braised	in	a	coq	au	vin	blanc	and	serve	it	with	spinach.	The	dish	is	simple,	but	I	just	love	the
flavors.

Andrew	Carmellini	of	New	York’s	A	Voce	on	Cooking
Chicken	as	a	Two-Part	Process	—	and	Applying	It	to
Chicken	Cacciatore

1.	Brining:	Sometimes	the	older	techniques	inspire	me	for	deeper	flavors.	Many	of	these	techniques
are	overlooked.	Take	brining,	for	instance.	Brining	has	been	done	forever	with	pork	chops	and	chicken,
and	for	the	last	five	years	you	have	heard	about	it	with	turkey.	The	success	of	brining	is	more	about	the
salt	and	it	getting	in	there	and	softening	the	protein	strands.	It	is	less	about	all	the	other	flavoring	agents.

If	you	want	to	get	started	in	your	kitchen,	start	with	a	skin-	and	bone-on	chicken	breast.	Grab	some
kosher	salt,	sugar,	or	honey	as	I	do,	some	water,	and	brine	the	breast	for	30	minutes.	When	you	pull	it	out
of	the	brine,	rinse	it,	dry	it,	and	let	it	sit	in	the	refrigerator	for	a	couple	of	hours	so	the	moisture	comes	out.
You	will	notice	the	difference	in	the	texture.	The	marinated	chicken	—	even	if	you	overcook	it	—	will	not
be	dry.	It	is	the	best.

2.	Marinating:	The	chicken	on	my	menu	right	now	is	brined	and	then	marinated	for	24	hours.	It	is

crazy	how	good	the	chicken	becomes.	The	marinade	is	made	up	of	roasted	garlic,	Sicilian	oregano,	red
pepper	flakes,	lots	of	lemon,	thyme,	and	olive	oil.	We	joke	that	it	tastes	like	Zesty	Italian	Wish-Bone
Dressing.	It	is	so	delicious.

The	finished	dish	is	served	with	poached	and	sautéed	artichoke,	roasted	pepper	grilled	over	wood,
fennel,	and	roasted	spring	onions.	These	vegetables	are	all	tossed	with	pesto,	and	the	dish	is	finished	with
a	tomato	sauce	made	with	foamy	tomato	water	and	thyme.

Chicken	Cacciatore
We	opened	up	A	Voce	with	chicken	cacciatore	on	our	menu	and	when	people	heard	the
name	of	the	dish,	they’d	just	yawn.	A	lot	of	times,	this	dish	is	just	chicken	scaloppine	with
peppers	and	tomatoes.	Ours	is	a	whole	different	dish:	the	chicken	is	on	the	bone,	and
brined	first,	which	makes	it	nice	and	moist.	With	it,	we	serve	a	homemade	peperonata	with
roasted	peppers,	onions,	garlic,	red	pepper	flakes,	rosemary,	fresh	bay	leaf,	fresh	thyme,
and	piment	d’Espelette	[a	pepper	from	France	with	a	smoky	flavor].	Here	is	a	place	where
technique	plays	a	role	in	the	flavor:	When	you	roast	peppers,	the	best	way	to	get	the	skin
off	is	to	put	them	in	a	bowl	covered	with	plastic	wrap	and	let	them	steam.	When	they	are
done,	you	are	left	with	the	pepper	liquid.	What	we	do	is	cook	with	that	liquid.

To	finish	this	dish,	we	put	a	big	scoop	of	the	pepper	mixture,	tomato	sauce,	garlic
puree,	onion,	red	wine	vinegar,	and	fresh	bay	leaf	on	the	chicken	and	put	it	in	the	oven	to
roast.	The	chicken	cooks	in	its	own	juice	then	is	served	with	roasted	potatoes.	It	is


delicious.

What	we	are	doing	is	layering	the	flavors.	You	have	the	technique	of	brining	the	chicken,

elevating	the	flavor	profile	of	the	peppers	with	the	sweetness	of	the	onions	and	herbs,
adding	a	little	heat	from	the	piment	d’Espelette,	and	giving	body	to	the	sauce	from	the
pepper	juice,	which	is	distilled	pepper	brandy.

My	chocolate-corn	dessert	[of	soft	chocolate	ganache	and	sweet	corn	in	three	textures:	crunchy	corn	and
hazelnut	corn	sorbet,	and	corn	tuile]	was	inspired	by	freeze-dried	corn.	[The	kernels]	are	whole	with	a
vibrant	sweetness.	Corn	dates	back	to	the	Aztecs,	who	also	loved	chocolate,	so	it’s	funny	when	people
ask,	“Where’d	you	get	the	inspiration?”	This	starts	with	a	layer	of	milk	chocolate	hazelnut	praline	paste,
then	the	corn,	and	then	crushed	wafers	that	give	it	that	Kit	Kat	candy	bar	texture;	on	top	of	that	is	some
chocolate	ganache,	then	a	layer	of	chocolate.	To	play	off	those	flavors	I	serve	some	espelette	[pepper]	to
give	a	little	heat	and	some	smoked	salt	from	Wales.	This	dish	is	about	the	interplay	of	the	chocolate	and
the	corn.	The	espelette	gives	a	heat	that	reminds	me	of	roasted	corn	salsa.	This	is	an	ode	to	the	origin	of
the	inspiration.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

It	is	hard	to	think	of	a	fruit	or	nut	that	is	not	improved	by	combining	it	with	chocolate.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	love	chocolate	with	fruit	or	nuts	or	both.	My	favorite	candy	bar	in	the	world	is	a	Cadbury	Fruit	and	Nut


bar.	On	my	menu	I	have	a	chocolate,	hazelnut,	and	orange	dessert,	which	is	essentially	a	Cadbury!
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	it	comes	to	chocolate,	keep	it	simple.	That’s	always	good	advice!	For	simplicity	at	its	best,	only
two	ingredients	are	necessary:	heavy	cream	and	chopped	chocolate.	Bring	the	cream	to	a	boil,	pour	it
over	the	chocolate,	and	it	turns	into	ganache.	Serve	it	warm	with	just	a	spoon.	How	can	you	do	any	better?
In	my	new	book,	I	feature	a	recipe	called	Cup	O’	Dark	Chocolate,	and	essentially	it	is	ganache	poured
into	a	cup.	Then	you	grab	a	cookie,	and	have	at	it!

If	you	want	to	dip	fruit	into	chocolate,	dried	fruits	such	as	figs,	pear,	and	pineapple	all	work	really
well.	People	always	ask	what	they	can	serve	to	impress	their	sweetheart	on	Valentine’s	Day,	and	fresh
strawberries	are	really	nice	in	February.	Just	make	a	warm	ganache,	grab	the	strawberries,	and	start
dipping.	Fresh	grapes	are	fantastic	with	chocolate.	Dip	them	into	the	melted	chocolate,	pop	them	in	the
freezer,	and	when	they	are	frozen,	put	them	into	a	two-quart	container.	That	way,	you	will	always	have	a
little	treat	in	the	freezer.	Be	careful	though	—	they	are	not	M&Ms,	so	they	will	melt	in	your	hands!

Everybody	is	on	the	chocolate	bandwagon	now,	and	we	are	not	far	away	from	the	proverbial	“man	on	the
street”	knowing	the	difference	between	a	72	percent	and	a	66	percent	chocolate.	The	boutique	chocolate
makers	are	now	coming	up	with	estate	and	varietal	and	vintage	chocolates.	I	love	that,	but	honestly,	once
you	add	enough	sugar	and	cream	to	chocolate,	those	nuances	are	all	gone.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

People	always	ask	why	I	use	bittersweet	versus	semisweet	chocolate.	Semisweet	is	chocolate	that	needs
salt.	When	you	add	salt	to	it,	it	brings	up	the	bitter	flavor	and	makes	it	taste	bittersweet.	Semisweet
chocolate	to	me	tastes	kind	of	flat.	Milk	chocolate	can	taste	flat	as	well.	Now	that	there	is	Scharffen
Berger	and	El	Rey	on	the	market,	I	find	both	those	chocolates	to	be	really,	really	great,	with	both	flavor
and	kick	to	them.	But	if	you	want	a	killer	chocolate	dessert,	don’t	use	milk	chocolate.

When	I	write	a	dessert	menu,	there	will	be	a	couple	of	chocolate	desserts,	with	one	being	a	killer

chocolate	and	the	other	a	lighter	option,	like	chocolate	with	bananas.	If	you	don’t	have	something
intensely	chocolate,	chocolate	lovers	are	very,	very	unhappy.	Banana	soufflé	with	chocolate	is	not
considered	a	chocolate	dessert.	You	have	to	be	careful	with	a	killer	chocolate	dessert	—	you	can’t	just
put	chocolate,	chocolate,	and	chocolate	together.	There	has	to	be	balance	so	the	dessert	is	not	too	rich.	To
achieve	balance,	turn	to	coffee	or	caramel	because	they	pair	so	well	and	help	to	intensify	the	chocolate
flavor.

For	some	desserts,	I	like	to	combine	white	and	dark	chocolate,	or	milk	and	dark	chocolate,	to	give
balance	and	cut	intensity.	It	sounds	crazy,	but	you	can	use	one	chocolate	to	mellow	the	flavor	of	another.
I’m	not	a	fan	of	herbs	with	dessert,	with	the	possible	exception	of	chocolate.	I	love	the	combination

of	chocolate	with	mint.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	don’t	have	a	big	sweet	tooth	but	I	do	like	all	kinds	of	chocolate,	from	dark	to	white.	Each	one	is
completely	different.	I	like	the	bitterness	and	clean	flavor	of	dark	chocolate.	I	like	milk	chocolate	with	a
piece	of	bread	like	when	I	was	a	kid.	You	have	to	select	your	white	chocolate	carefully	because	not	all	of
it	is	good.	White	chocolate	works	well	in	a	mousse;	it	has	a	more	neutral	flavor	and	does	not	dictate.
Dark	chocolate	is	all	about	being	the	star,	versus	white,	that	is	better	to	play	with.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Dark	chocolate	goes	really	well	with	coffee	or	caramel,	but	if	I	could	only	pick	one	it	would	be	the
caramel!	Caramel	and	chocolate	play	so	well	together	despite	both	being	strong	flavors.

I	make	a	cake	with	dark	cocoa,	which	makes	for	a	bitter	chocolate	flavor,	and	then	in	the	middle	a	milk


chocolate	cream.	Many	people	don’t	realize	how	great	the	chocolate	flavor	of	cocoa	is.	It	adds	bitterness
and	intensity	without	adding	richness.	That	is	invaluable	because	so	many	chocolate	desserts	are	so	rich.
Often	when	I	make	a	chocolate	ice	cream,	I	will	combine	melted	chocolate	and	cocoa.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

My	dessert	of	milk	chocolate	pot	de	crème,	caramel	foam,	maple	syrup,	and	Maldon	sea	salt	served	in	an
emptied-out	eggshell	symbolizes	that	a	few	ingredients	can	come	together	in	a	way	that	is	greater	than	the
sum	of	their	parts.	The	key	ingredient	which	ties	it	together	is	the	Maldon	sea	salt.	This	combination
elevates	all	the	ingredients.

Starting	with	chocolate,	caramel	was	the	logical	next	step.	At	the	time,	I	played	with	fleur	de	sel,	red

salt	from	Hawaii,	and	others,	before	ending	up	with	the	Maldon.	I	like	the	concept	of	using	sugar	as	a
seasoning,	beyond	its	natural	necessity	in	dessert.	I	also	like	natural	sweetness	from	things	and	maple
sugar	brings	a	lot	of	flavor	beyond	sweetness.	Once	I	hit	upon	this	combination,	I	have	never	changed	it.

some	smoothness	to	it.	It	is	not	going	to	have	the	acidity	that	dark	chocolate	has.	When	you	are	making	a
dessert	with	white	chocolate,	it	is	going	to	be	a	softer,	smoother	dessert.	I	don’t	like	dark	chocolate	and
raspberries	together,	but	I	believe	I	am	one	of	the	few	chefs	who	feel	this	way.	What	I	don’t	like	is	that
when	you	take	a	bite	of	the	chocolate	with	the	berry,	the	acidity	of	the	two	don’t	blend.	The	acids	are	too
similar,	so	it	doesn’t	feel	like	a	single	dessert	in	your	mouth.	Instead,	it	is	a	clash	with	both	of	them
bouncing	into	each	other	in	your	mouth.	They	don’t	bridge,	and	even	whipped	cream	doesn’t	bring	them
together.	But	if	you	use	white	chocolate,	its	softness	works	much	better	with	berries.	The	white	chocolate
complements	the	berries	and	brings	out	their	flavors.	Citrus,	especially	anything	in	the	orange	family,	also
works	well	with	white	chocolate.	Nuts,	such	as	almonds,	work	well	with	white	chocolate.	Spices	also
work	well	with	white	chocolate.

CILANTRO

Season:	spring–summer

Weight:	light,	soft-leaved

Tips:	Always	use	fresh,	not	cooked	—	or,	if	you	must,	add	at	the	very	last	minute.

Use	cilantro	to	provide	a	cooling	note	to	chile	pepper–	spiced	dishes.

After	a	visit	to	Spain,	I	created	a	chorizo	broth	to	go	with	monkfish.	I	love	chorizo,	with	its	paprika
flavors	and	the	fattiness	of	the	pork.	So	I	had	to	figure	out	how	to	make	a	sauce	out	of	a	dried	piece	of
sausage.	We	melted	the	chorizo	in	a	pan	for	a	long	time,	and	ended	up	with	a	flavorful	grease	that	was	not
that	appealing.	However,	we	emulsified	it	in	an	herb-infused	clam	broth,	and	it	became	velvety.	It	wasn’t
greasy,	and	gave	the	sauce	a	little	kick.	I	chose	this	sauce	to	go	with	monkfish	because	it	is	a	meaty	fish
and	can	stand	up	to	spice	and	to	strong	flavors	really	well.	Chorizo	would	not	destroy	the	soul	of	the	fish.

I	like	the	anise-seed	quality	to	cilantro,	which	is	really	good	with	figs.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	really	like	using	cilantro	for	its	lemony	and	floral	qualities,	even	though	it’s	very	non-European.	I’ll	put
cilantro	stems	[not	the	leaves]	in	the	cavity	when	I’m	roasting	a	chicken,	and	I	find	it	lifts	the	flavor.
Cilantro	stems	are	also	wonderful	in	Spanish-themed	stews	when	there’s	a	lot	of	depth	of	flavor	from
ingredients	like	chorizo,	chickpeas,	oxtails,	or	tripe,	and	it	needs	a	high	note.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Love	it	or	hate	it,	cilantro	is	in	a	lot	of	my	dishes!	I	love	its	citrus	flavor.	Cilantro	has	long	legs;	we	use	it
to	make	cilantro	oil	as	well	as	purees.	It	lends	itself	well	to	white	meats	but	I	have	even	put	it	on	hanger
steak	and	wild	boar.	I	also	like	it	with	coconut	milk.

My	coconut	rice	pudding	strudel	was	the	result	of	Takashi’s	influence.	[Takashi	Yagihashi	was	his	chef	at
Detroit’s	Tribute	restaurant.]	Dessert	has	to	make	sense	in	the	context	of	the	rest	of	the	meal.	Being	a
pastry	chef	is	exciting	because	you	have	a	lot	of	autonomy,	but	you	are	still	working	within	the	chef’s
framework.	Takashi’s	food	was	very	Asian-influenced.	This	dish	was	meant	to	bring	in	Asian	ingredients
in	a	new	way	yet	be	something	familiar.

So	we	have	rice	pudding	flavored	with	coconut,	lemongrass,	ginger,	and	vanilla,	and	diced	apricot
for	texture.	At	the	time	I	was	introduced	to	frie	de	brique,	which	is	a	Moroccan	dough	that	is	like	a	cross
between	phyllo	and	a	wonton	wrapper.	I	would	wrap	these	ingredients	in	this	dough	and	then	sauté	them
in	clarified	butter	and	slice	them	like	a	spring	roll.	Alongside	I	served	green	tea	ice	cream.	This	covered
a	lot	of	bases	for	me:	the	warm	and	cold	temperatures,	the	Asian	influence,	and	doing	something	with
boring	old	rice	pudding.

The	coolest	compliment	I	ever	got	was	from	Andrew	Carmellini	[chef	of	New	York’s	A	Voce]	who
was	sitting	down	with	us	and	asked	about	my	background.	When	I	said	I	used	to	be	a	line	cook,	he	said,	“I
knew	it	—	a	pastry	chef	would	never	come	up	with	that!”	It	was	the	combination	of	techniques	and
flavors	as	well	as	sautéing	something	to	order.

We	participate	in	an	event	called	“Plate	and	Pitchfork”	that	is	held	on	a	farm	with	the	food	from	the	farm.
The	guests	sit	in	the	field	among	the	corn	and	tomatoes,	and	we	cook	a	meal	for	them	on	a	couple	of
grills.	I	made	a	corn	soup	for	this	event.	We	removed	the	husks,	then	cut	the	kernels	off	the	cob.	Then	we
used	the	husks,	which	produce	a	juice,	to	make	a	stock	for	the	soup.	If	you	were	to	use	cobs,	you	wouldn’t
get	the	same	flavor.	It	is	important	to	keep	the	corn	flavor	pure.	Most	cooks	would	throw	in	a	bunch	of
vegetables	in	the	stock,	and	what	you’d	get	then	is	a	vegetable	stock	with	corn.	I	want	to	have	a	corny
flavor	in	the	end.	We	made	a	stock	using	the	corn	husks	cooked	with	a	little	onion,	water,	and	salt,	and	let
it	cook	for	about	45	minutes.	What	came	out	was	the	most	amazing	sweet	broth.	We	added	the	corn,
pureed	it,	and	served	it	chilled.	It	was	so	sweet	and	full	of	corn	flavor	you	would	have	sworn	there	were
cream	and	sugar	in	it.

We	now	make	a	corn	husk	broth	to	add	to	a	corn,	chanterelle,	and	Dungeness	crab	risotto	with	a	touch

of	pesto.	Basil	pesto	and	corn	really	speaks	to	me.	It	is	a	wonderful	combination.
—	VITALY	PALEY,	PALEY’S	PLACE	(PORTLAND,	OREGON)

—	MICHAEL	ANTHONY,	GRAMERCY	TAVERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Crab	is	something	that	you	typically	see	steamed	and	served	with	butter.	King	crab	is	intensely	flavorful,
meaty,	and	salty.	When	it	is	caught	at	sea,	it	is	cooked	on	the	boat	with	heavily	salted	water.	The	first	thing
I	did	was	soak	the	crab	multiple	times	in	ice	water	to	draw	out	all	the	salt.	I	saw	and	created	a	vision	of
this	red	crabmeat	within	a	barigoule	with	perfectly	cut	vegetables,	artichokes,	French	green	beans,
Valencia	oranges,	sweet	garlic,	and	finished	with	olive	oil.
—	CARRIE	NAHABEDIAN,	Naha	(Chicago)

When	making	crab	cakes,	I’ll	use	whole	shrimp	—	the	meat	in	the	cakes,	and	the	shrimp	heads	in	the
sauce	—	to	intensify	the	shellfish	flavor.

CREAM

Crayfish,	Beet,	Leek,	and	Bacon	Salad	with	Mustard	Vinaigrette
—	Daniel	Boulud,	at	the	2003	James	Beard	Awards	gala	reception

When	you	eat	a	piece	of	pumpkin	pie,	the	whipped	cream	is	the	first	thing	you	go	for!	You	can	take	this


for	granted	in	desserts,	or	you	can	dig	deeper:	You	can	think	of	cream	as	its	own	flavor.	When	I	was	in
Japan,	the	cream	was	miles	better	than	here	in	the	U.S.	You	also	need	to	think	about	your	dairy	choice	in
relation	to	the	country.	In	India,	everything	is	centered	around	reduced	milk.	The	counterpart	would	be
dolce	de	leche	in	Latin	cuisine.	I	love	yogurt	because	it	is	simple	and	complex;	it	can	be	in	the	forefront
or	in	the	background.

Torrijas,	which	means	“soaked,”	are	a	[custardy]	dessert	in	the	Basque	country	that	are	like	French	toast
or	pain	perdu.	We	soak	the	bread	until	it	is	saturated	in	milk,	then	let	it	sit	[in	the	refrigerator]	overnight.
The	next	morning	before	serving,	we	coat	it	in	egg	and	then	fry	it.	We	serve	our	version	of	torrijas	with
poached	apples	and	instead	of	serving	it	with	maple	syrup,	we	serve	it	with	Pedro	Ximenez	[a	rich,
sweet,	Spanish	sherry]	syrup	that	has	a	raisin-like	quality	to	it.	The	PX	is	just	warmed	and	has	a	little
glucose	added	to	thicken	it	into	a	syrup.	I	don’t	cook	it	or	reduce	it	because	I	want	to	keep	the	alcohol	in
the	syrup	so	it	doesn’t	become	overly	cloying.
—	ALEXANDRA	RAIJ,	TÍA	POL	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Daikon	is	great	in	stews	and	is	milder,	sweeter,	and	more	absorbent	than	turnips	or	radishes.	Duck	and
turnips	is	a	classic,	but	I	like	duck	with	daikon	even	better.	It	pairs	well	with	other	heavier	flavors,	such
as	pork	or	beef.

Medjool	Dates	with	Maple	Mascarpone,	Pistachios,	and	Orange	Blossom	Water
—	Monica	Pope,	T’afia	(Houston)

Someone	told	me	about	a	savory	date	dish	they	had	but	could	only	remember	that	it	was	stuffed	and
wrapped	in	bacon.	This	led	me	into	the	kitchen	to	stuff	a	date	with	chorizo,	wrap	it	in	bacon,	and	then	add
charmoula	[typically	made	of	paprika,	cayenne	pepper,	cumin,	garlic,	lemon	juice,	parsley,	cilantro,	and
olive	oil].	The	dish	just	hits	the	mark.	I	also	serve	a	sweet	date	dish	that	I	stole	from	Judy	Rodgers	of	Zuni
Café.	My	version	is	made	with	Medjool	dates	that	have	maple	mascarpone	smeared	in,	pistachios
crumbled	on	top,	and	orange	blossom	water.	The	orange	blossom	water	gives	people	a	visceral	reaction
because	you	don’t	see	it,	but	you	taste	it.	When	people	have	the	dish,	they	lick	their	fingers	trying	to	figure
it	out!
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

Emily	Luchetti	of	Farallon	in	San	Francisco	on	When	and
How	to	Serve	Dessert
The	older	I	get,	the	more	I	like	my	dessert	at	3:00	in	the	afternoon.	I	like	it	all	by	itself,	it
has	no	competition	and	you	are	usually	hungry.	Your	taste	buds	are	wide	awake	and	you
can	appreciate	what	it	is.	Of	course	if	we	have	people	over	for	dinner	I	can’t	get	away	with
not	serving	dessert!

When	you	serve	a	dessert	after	a	meal	you	are	already	full,	not	in	a	bad	way,	but	if	you
had	a	first	course	and	main	course	your	palate	has	gone	through	many	flavor	components.
At	home	I	always	take	a	little	break	and	give	people	a	breather	between	dinner	and
dessert.	I’ll	have	my	guests	help	with	the	dishes	or,	if	it’s	a	formal	party,	I’ll	let	them	talk	for
a	half	hour	and	finish	off	the	red	wine.	It	is	not	just	for	their	stomachs	but	for	the	palate	as
well.

I	hate	when	it	comes	to	slicing	a	dessert	and	someone	says,	“No,	no,	that	is	too	big!”	I
used	to	fight	it	and	take	it	personally,	so	now	I	just	ask	in	advance.	The	guest	appreciates
it,	has	a	small	piece,	and	then	has	seconds.	It	is	recognizing	that	everyone	has	their	own
choice	regarding	how	much	they	want	to	eat.	If	I	am	serving	a	shortcake,	I	will	put	the	fruit
with	a	little	cream	on	the	cake,	then	pass	a	bowl	of	whipped	cream,	so	whether	they	want
to	pile	it	or	keep	it	light,	they	can.

DESSERTS

Tips:	Sweetness	satiates	the	appetite,	so	generally	end	a	meal	on	a	sweet	note.

Even	sweet	desserts	should	be	in	balance	(their	acidity,	saltiness,	etc.).
Dessert	wine	should	always	be	sweeter	than	the	dessert	it	accompanies.

—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

Eggplant	can	take	on	an	even	richer,	meatier	flavor	when	it’s	enhanced	with	miso	or	tahini.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

My	eggplant	gazpacho	really	tastes	like	a	baba	ghanoush	soup.	We	start	the	soup	by	roasting	eggplant	and
onions.	Then	we	blend	this	together	with	tahini,	tomato	water,	buttermilk	for	acidity,	lemon,	and	garlic.
The	soup	is	garnished	with	three	gels	made	of	eggplant,	lemon,	and	onion	—	all	flavors	from	the	soup.	I
love	texture	—	people	joke	with	me	and	call	me	“Captain	Crunch”	—	so	at	the	last	second,	we	top	the
soup	with	Rice	Krispies.

I	like	frittata	as	a	main	course	at	lunch	or	dinner.	You	can	simply	have	frittata	with	a	soup,	and	it’s	a
meal.	Frittata	is	like	a	risotto	in	its	versatility;	you	can	go	crazy	with	it	and	add	almost	anything	to	them.	I
love	my	frittata	with	vegetables;	asparagus,	artichokes,	mushrooms,	onions,	zucchini	all	work.	With	any
variety	of	vegetables	I	would	add	some	fresh	herbs	and	cheese.	Since	the	eggs	are	the	protein,	the	only
thing	I	don’t	personally	care	for	in	my	frittata	is	meat,	or	maybe	pickled	vegetables.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

We	will	serve	the	combination	of	poached	egg	and	spring	asparagus	differently	at	brunch	versus	dinner.
At	brunch,	we	will	serve	sliced	asparagus	mixed	with	other	sliced	vegetables	in	the	bottom	of	a	cazuela
[clay	pot]	with	the	poached	egg	on	top.	For	dinner,	it	will	be	green	market	asparagus	topped	with	a

I	have	always	loved	to	mix	meat	and	fish	in	a	very	delicate	way.	I	went	to	Cut	[Wolfgang	Puck’s	steak
restaurant]	and	had	my	first	true	Kobe	beef	steak.	I	begged	Lee	[Hefter,	the	chef]	for	his	source!	Surf	and
turf	is	not	as	much	about	having	a	piece	of	meat	and	fish	on	the	plate	as	about	the	ideas	they	create	for
flavor	combinations.	The	Kobe	beef	triggered	everything.	I	can’t	serve	steak	at	a	fish	restaurant,	but	the
Kobe	was	so	good	I	had	to	find	a	way	to	justify	it	on	the	menu.	I	came	up	with	Kobe	beef	and	escalar,
with	a	brown	butter	that	is	classic	with	the	fish.	The	final	dish	was	inspired	by	having	Korean	barbecue	at
a	friend’s	house,	which	is	when	I	realized	how	to	bring	it	together.

I	wanted	another	element	in	the	dish	because	the	Kobe,	escalar,	and	brown	butter	are	all	rich	and	all
soft.	The	dish	also	has	squash,	Japanese	pears,	and	napa	cabbage	marinated	like	Korean	kimchee	for	just
a	moment.	These	elements	add	contrast,	chewiness,	and	crunchiness.

dried	meats	like	prosciutto.	It	also	pairs	nicely	with	shellfish	like	langoustines,	lobster,	or	crab.	Fennel
can	work	with	fish	as	well	as	with	meat.	It	goes	really	well	with	cold	poached	salmon	or	white,	light
meats	like	chicken	or	veal.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Fennel	is	a	flavor	I	like	so	much	that	I	have	to	show	restraint	with	it.	You	can	add	anything	to	itbecause
other	flavors	really	adhere	to	it.	You	can	braise	it	in	olive	oil	and	veal	stock	to	get	one	flavor.	Or	you	can
braise	it	in	olive	oil,	white	wine,	and	water	and	get	a	whole	other	flavor.	Or	you	can	quarter	it,
caramelize	it,	and	roast	it	in	the	oven	—	now	you	have	a	sugar	flavor	and	it	can	become	a	dessert.	I	love
fennel	every	way	including	braised,	caramelized,	dried,	candied,	and	pureed.	In	the	fall,	I	served	raw
shaved	fennel	with	arugula,	and	shaved	Honeycrisp	apple	with	a	dressing	made	of	apple	cider,	honey,	and
mustard.	Fennel	puts	the	salad	over	the	top	with	its	crunch.	In	summer,	we	serve	a	fennel	and	fig	tarte	tatin
with	duck.	You	get	a	Fig	Newton	flavor	from	the	fig	and	Pernod	flavor	from	the	fennel;	they	match	really
well.

Fennel	pollen	has	a	light,	fennel-anise	flavor	with	a	floral	component.	It	is	delicate,	so	you	don’t	cook
with	it	—	you	just	finish	a	dish	with	it.	It	is	great	on	lighter	things	like	salads,	poached	or	steamed	flaky
white	fish,	poultry,	or	pork.	When	a	dish	has	fennel	pollen,	even	before	the	food	hits	your	mouth	you	will
notice	a	floral	smell	that	gets	you	thinking	of	summer,	lighter	foods,	and	freshness.	I	use	it	with	my	sea
trout	dish,	which	is	served	with	a	simple	salad	of	green	apple,	fennel,	jicama,	pistachios,	and	dried
gooseberries.	The	dish	is	topped	with	the	pollen	blended	with	some	yogurt,	lemon	juice,	and	preserved
lemon,	which	we	drape	over	the	fish.	This	dish	just	screams	“summer.”	With	a	glass	of	Sauvignon	Blanc
on	the	terrace	in	the	early	evening,	you’re	set!
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	really	like	fennel	pollen.	The	majority	of	the	time,	we	use	it	in	a	marinade	for	meats	like	pork,	boar,
chicken,	and	lamb.	It	adds	an	interesting	herbaceous,	aromatic	note	and	a	mysterious	flavor.

Think	of	white	fish	—	dorade,	Dover	sole,	pompano,	skate,	snapper	—	as	white	meat,	and	red	fish	—
salmon,	tuna	—	as	red	meat.	Salmon	is	like	pork,	and	tuna	like	beef,	and	both	combine	better	with
stronger	flavors.	Tuna	even	pairs	with	some	of	the	same	flavors	as	beef,	including	black	pepper,	red

to	them.	I	don’t	believe	you	need	10,000	things	for	a	great	piece	of	fish.	Dover	sole	doesn’t	need	anything.
Turbot	has	a	wonderful	flavor	with	no	help.	We	get	our	baby	octopus	from	Sicily	and	they	have	plenty	of
flavor.

—	Jimmy	Schmidt,	at	the	2003	James	Beard	Awards	gala	reception

I	found	a	recipe	for	olive	oil	cake	at	the	same	time	that	I	was	perfecting	making	a	foie	gras	mousse	that
was	pliable	to	the	point	that	it	could	be	made	into	an	icing.	So,	I	created	a	savory	cake	topped	with	the
icing.	Then	one	day	while	I	was	online	I	heard	someone	mention	Twinkies,	and	the	next	thing	I	knew	I
was	ordering	real	Twinkie	pans	online.	Three	days	later,	Twinkies	stuffed	with	foie	gras	was	born.	I
serve	it	with	fresh	strawberries	and	black	pepper.	It	seems	like	everything	has	been	done	already,	but	I
like	to	think	I	am	the	only	person	working	with	Twinkies.

Tarte	flambéeis	a	dish	that	is	200	years	old	and	was	originally	made	by	farmers	in	Alsace	in	the	village’s
wood-burning	oven	used	for	baking	bread.	The	tarte	flambée	developed	from	what	was	on	hand	on	the
farm:	cheese	and	cream	from	the	cow,	pork	from	the	pig,	and	onions	from	the	field,	which	they	added	to
some	dough.	Since	we	don’t	have	a	wood-burning	oven	[in	the	middle	of	Manhattan],	we	have	to	tweak
the	recipe	from	the	classic.	We	have	to	tweak	the	cream	because	if	we	don’t,	it	breaks	and	just	becomes
grease.	Instead,	I	use	a	mix	of	fromage	blanc,	cream,	and	sour	cream	so	I	can	get	the	same	result	as	cream
in	the	original.	And	to	compensate	for	not	having	a	fire,	I	use	an	applewood-smoked	bacon.

When	garlic	needs	to	be	there,	it	needs	to	be	there.	That	includes	a	lot	of	dishes,	such	as	lamb.	Garlic	is
also	called	for	with	all	kinds	of	vegetables,	sauces,	pastas,	and	salads.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	use	garlic	primarily	in	two	ways:	infused	into	olive	oil,	or	served	crispy	as	a	garnish.	I’ll	use	the	garlic
oil	for	cooking	—	and	even	if	a	dish	will	have	garlic	added	later,	I	will	start	with	this	oil.	For	crispy
brown	garlic,	you	start	by	slicing	it		thinly	like	a	chip.	The	garlic	is	then	put	into	cold	olive	oil	and	cooked
until	it	is	just	brown.	Then,	you	add	parsley,	red	pepper	flakes,	and	an	acid	like	lemon	juice	or	vinegar	to
make	a	vinaigrette.	You	can	even	add	some	stock	like	a	fumet,	which	is	wonderful,	too	—	served	hot,	it	is
great	with	almost	any	kind	of	fish,	from	something	light	all	the	way	to	oily	blue	fish.

Cucumber	and	mint	is	a	fashionable	combination	in	cocktails,	[especially]	those	with	Hendrick’s	gin,

—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I’ll	use	ginger	more	for	its	heat	than	its	sweetness.	For	example,	I’ll	juice	it	to	add	to	a	carrot	or	squash
puree,	which	gives	it	heat	and	backbone.

Ginger	is	great	on	its	own,	but	also	works	great	with	other	flavors.	It’s	one	of	those	“wake	up”	flavors
that	you	can	hide	beneath	all	sorts	of	other	flavors.	I	think	it	works	especially	well	with	citrus.	It	works
with	yuzu,	passion	fruit,	coconut,	banana,	and	other	tropical	flavors.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

My	mom	always	had	candied	ginger	in	the	spice	cupboard	when	I	was	growing	up.	Today	at	the
restaurant,	we	take	candied	ginger	and	combine	it	with	whatever	fruit	is	in	season	—	from	nectarines,	to
cherries,	to	quince	—	and	then	add	Vin	Santo	to	make	a	sauce	for	our	foie	gras.	Vin	Santo	brings	nuttiness


and	candied	ginger	brings	spice	that	both	cut	through	the	fat	of	the	foie	gras.	I	think	nectarines	and	candied
ginger	are	a	perfect	flavor	combination.

We	serve	a	dish	of	grapefruit,	crab	salad,	and	mint.	Grapefruit	is	sweet	and	a	little	bitter,	which	makes	it
fun	to	play	with.	I	like	mint	in	the	dish	because	it	refreshes	and	wakes	your	palate	up.	When	you	get	a

Halibut	from	the	East	Coast	is	the	most	delicate	and	silky	fish.	It	is	different	than	Alaskan	halibut,	which
is	drier,	meatier,	and	more	robust.	East	Coast	halibut	is	so	delicate	that	anything	can	kill	it.	That	is	why
we	steam	and	poach	so	much	here:	Even	searing	it	too	strongly	in	the	pan	will	hurt	a	piece	of	halibut.

We’ll	poach	halibut,	then	serve	it	with	a	blood	orange	vinaigrette	made	with	extra-virgin	olive	oil,
which	gives	it	a	round	and	full	flavor.	The	fish	is	then	served	atop	a	carpaccio	of	golden	beets	that	have
been	cooked	in	sherry	vinegar.	The	beets	have	a	sweet-and-sour	flavor	to	them.	They	are	also	very
crunchy,	which	I	like	with	the	creamy	texture	of	the	halibut.	The	vinaigrette	brings	the	right	degree	of
acidity	to	the	dish	to	make	it	exciting.
—	ERIC	RIPERT,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Halibut	is	a	gentle-tasting	fish,	which	leads	to	gentle	herbs	like	cilantro,	chives,	or	chervil.

Just	let	it	rest	on	your	tongue	and	let	your	37	degrees	Celsius	do	the	rest!	You	can	use	just	the	fat	of
Ibérico	ham	melted	in	a	pan	and	make	scrambled	eggs	or	a	tortilla,	and	it	will	add	amazing	flavor	and

Hazelnuts	are	from	the	north	and	are	used	in	Piedmontese	cooking.	Hazelnuts	are	very	rich	and	round	and
buttery,	so	I	will	use	them	to	achieve	a	rich,	fatty	quality	in	my	dessert.	Hazelnuts	with	chocolate	are	a
natural.	Hazelnut	with	grapes	are	great;	it’s	like	peanut	butter	and	jelly!
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	am	more	of	an	herb	guy	than	a	spice	guy.	It	comes	back	to	a	certain	conservatism	I	have	regarding	food.
The	French	are	not	big	on	spices;	they	use	more	herbs.	I	know	the	spices	used	in	European	cooking	and
use	them	in	moderation.	I	am	not	going	to	serve	a	dish	that	is	wildly	nutmegged!

HERBS	(See	specific	herbs)

Herbs	101	with	Jerry	Traunfeld	of	The	Herbfarm,
Woodinville,	Washington
Working	with	herbs	is	very	different	from	working	with	spices.	With	herbs,	you	can	really
only	work	with	a	few	at	a	time.	With	spices,	you	can	throw	so	many	more	together.	An
Indian	dish	may	have	more	than	a	dozen	spices	in	it.	Here	are	some	guidelines:

•	Know	your	herb.	Herbs	range	in	intensity,	so	you	need	to	know	the	profile	of	the	herb	you	are	choosing
at	the	start.	You	need	to	be	careful;	for	example,	if	you	add	rosemary	to	chervil	it	will	overpower	the
chervil.
•	You	want	to	pair	delicate	with	delicate	or	strong	with	strong.	Chervil	is	possibly	the	most	delicate
herb.	Lemon	basil	and	lemon	thyme	would	be	in	the	middle.	Lemon	verbena	or	tarragon	I	would	consider
loud.	Then	you	have	bay	leaf	which	is	light,	until	you	add	twenty	together	and	it	becomes	strong.
•	Not	all	herbs	are	created	equal,	and	they	can	vary	within	their	categories	or	season.	Oregano	can	be


mild,	or	hot	and	spicy.	With	mint,	applemint	is	mild	while	peppermint	is	strong.	The	season	also	has	an
effect	on	rosemary:	in	the	winter,	rosemary	is	mild	and	in	the	summer,	it	is	strong.
•	Herbs	have	regional	affinities.	Mediterranean	herbs	marry	well	together.	Rosemary	and	marjoram	or
thyme	and	savory	are	naturals	together.	Among	Asian	herbs,	lemongrass	goes	with	mint	and	cilantro	or
mint	and	chives.	In	France,	you	have	lots	of	combinations:	chervil,	tarragon,	chives,	and	parsley.	The	one
exception	to	France’s	herbs	is	tarragon,	which	is	probably	best	on	its	own.
•	Herbs	also	have	seasonal	affinities.	Summer	vegetables	work	with	summer	herbs,	as	do	winter
vegetables	with	winter	herbs.	In	summer,	it	is	basil	or	marjoram	with	tomatoes.	Basil	with	zucchini	is	one
of	my	favorite	combinations.	In	winter,	sage	and	rosemary	work	with	potatoes	and	root	vegetables.	Also
in	winter,	one	of	my	favorite	combinations	is	butternut	squash	with	bay	leaf	and	nutmeg.	Pumpkin	and	bay
leaf	together	make	the	pumpkin	taste	even	more	pumpkin-like.
•	How	to	use	the	chosen	herb.	Soft-leaved	herbs	—	such	as	basil,	chervil,	chives,	cilantro,	dill,	lovage,
and	sorrel	—	shouldn’t	be	cooked	because	they	will	lose	their	flavor.	Tough-leaved	herbs	—	such	as	bay
leaf,	savory,	and	rosemary	—	can	go	into	dishes	and	stand	up	to	heat	and	cooking.
•	Choose	an	herb	that	is	the	same	intensity	as	your	protein.	Halibut	is	a	gentle-tasting	fish,	which	leads
to	gentle	herbs	like	cilantro,	chives,	or	chervil.	Smelt	is	a	local	fish	that	is	oily,	so	here	we	look	to
stronger	herbs	like	oregano,	savory,	or	rosemary.
•	Herbs	aren’t	exclusive	to	savory	dishes.	Anise	hyssop	works	with	most	stone	fruits	like	peaches.
Cinnamon	basil	works	with	blue	huckleberries.	Cinnamon	with	blueberries	really	intensifies	the	flavor	of
the	blueberry.	Lavender	works	with	plums	or	peaches.	Lemony	herbs	like	basil	or	anise	hyssop	work	with
watermelon.	Rosemary	works	with	apples	or	pears.	Sage	works	with	tart	cherries.	Tarragon	works	with
muskmelon.

We	grow	forty	different	tomatoes	and	eight	different	basils.	Our	farmer	planted	the	tomatoes	surrounded
by	the	basil,	and	I	thought	he	did	it	because	they	taste	good	together.	It	turns	out	that	doing	so	attracts
beneficial	insects	to	each.	Our	farmer	believes	that	tomato	and	basil	work	so	well	on	the	plate	because
they	work	so	well	in	the	field.	He	also	explained	that	if	you	plant	certain	basils	next	to	tomatoes,	you	can
taste	it	in	the	tomato.

All	our	cooks	take	care	of	their	own	section	of	the	herb	garden.	The	garde-manger	cooks	[who
prepare	appetizers]	look	after	the	chives	and	chervil.	The	fish	cooks	care	for	the	lemon	herbs	like	lemon
thyme	and	lemongrass,	and	the	meat	cooks	for	the	rosemary,	sage,	and	thyme.	Our	pastry	cooks	tend	the
edible	flowers	that	can	be	candied,	and	mint	and	lemon	verbena,	which	they	use	in	sorbets.
—	DAN	BARBER,	BLUE	HILL	AT	STONE	BARNS	(POCANTICO	HILLS,	NEW	YORK)

I	am	a	big	fan	of	roasting	and	resting	meat	on	herbs.	If	you	roast	a	rib	eye,	prime	rib,	or	filet	mignon,	most
people	would	put	it	on	a	sheet	tray	with	a	roasting	rack.	One	day,	I	didn’t	have	a	roasting	rack	but	I	had	a
lot	of	thyme	and	savory	and	rosemary,	so	I	threw	the	meat	on	top	and	roasted	it.	The	technique	did	the
trick	by	keeping	the	meat	from	the	juices	and	it	also	enhanced	the	flavor	that	much	more.	Since	then,	we
have	stopped	using	roasting	racks	for	our	meats	and	switched	to	herbs.	During	the	roasting	process,	I	like
to	turn	the	meat	so	that	the	flavor	of	the	herbs	penetrates	even	more.	Since	you	are	roasting	in	a	closed
oven,	the	air	circulates	the	herb	flavor.

For	a	lamb	shoulder,	if	you	can’t	get	hay,	I	would	recommend	using	savory,	thyme,	sage,	and
rosemary.	This	technique	is	great	for	a	whole	chicken:	slice	some	truffles	to	put	under	the	chicken	skin,
brush	it	with	butter,	and	put	it	on	a	bed	of	savory	and	thyme.	It	will	be	pretty	incredible.

I	use	honey	as	a	flavor,	not	as	a	sweetener	like	sugar.	In	my	honey	panna	cotta,	I	add	some	sugar	to	make
it	sweet	enough.	If	I	used	only	honey	as	a	sweetener,	the	flavor	of	honey	would	be	too	strong	and	the

Heating	grated	horseradish	changes	the	horseradish	completely.	It	makes	it	more	mellow	and	takes	away
the	bite	while	keeping	its	yummy	flavor.	Horseradish	prepared	this	way	works	well	with	Nantucket	Bay
scallops	that	are	naturally	sweet	and	work	with	the	sweetness	of	the	horseradish.	We	will	also	use	it	in	a
lemony	vinaigrette	and	dress	a	smoked	trout	with	it.

First,	grate	horseradish	on	a	microplane	[a	fine	grater].	Coat	a	ten-inch	skillet	with	some	Ligurian
olive	oil,	and	heat	the	horseradish	over	medium	heat.	Watch	it	very	closely,	because	the	minute	it	starts	to
turn	from	its	blond	color,	it	is	done.	From	there,	transfer	it	into	cold	pans	to	cool	it	quickly.	When	it	is
totally	cool	and	has	its	crunch,	add	some	lemon	zest	and	kosher	salt.

In	Eastern	European	or	Hungarian	cooking,	you	will	see	a	stewed	or	braised	dish	flavored	with	paprika
that	is	cut	with	sour	cream	either	in	it	or	served	on	top	so	that	it	mixes	together	as	you	eat	it.	I	serve	rare
roasted	venison	in	venison	stock	with	hot	and	sweet	paprika	that	is	essentially	a	goulash.	Alongside,	I
serve	creamed	sauerkraut	that	bleeds	into	the	sauce	and	gives	the	same	effect	as	a	goulash.	Even	though
the	sauerkraut	has	an	intense	flavor,	it	is	still	mild	because	it	has	been	cooked	in	cream.	It	is	not	a
Hungarian	dish	but	rather	a	play	on	a	Hungarian	dish,	and	it	works	in	the	context	of	the	subtler	intensity	of

If	my	mind	is	in	India,	tamarind	will	be	sneaking	its	way	into	the	dish.	When	thinking	of	India,	my
inspirations	are	the	flavors	of	clove,	cardamom,	and	coriander	seed.	They	are	aromatic	spices	that	really
cut	the	fat	of	the	dish,	so	it	is	not	big,	fat,	and	flabby	on	the	palate.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	worked	in	an	Indian	restaurant	as	a	waiter	for	four	years.	I	love	cooking	with	Indian	ingredients.
Everything	I	learned	at	the	CIA	was	thrown	out	the	window	when	I	learned	Indian	cooking,	which	is
where	I	picked	up	many	techniques	and	philosophies.	I	now	roast	my	own	spices	and	create	spice	blends.
I	love	creating	my	own	flavor	combinations.	I	came	to	love	a	garam	masala	made	with	fennel,	cinnamon,
clove,	cumin,	and	coriander.	Each	of	these	five	spices	has	a	distinctive	flavor,	but	combined	they	create
one	single	flavor	that	is	amazing.	I	will	use	my	garam	masala	mixture	in	soups	and	sauces.	When	people
ask	about	the	dish,	they	always	ask,	“What	was	that	flavor?”

Holly	Smith	of	Café	Juanita	in	Seattle	on	Five	Flavors	that
Will	Take	You	to	Northern	Italy
White	Truffles.	The	perfect	vehicle	for	white	truffles	is	hand-cut	pasta	that	is	egg	rich.
Eggs	that	taste	like	real	eggs	make	a	great	pasta.	Our	pasta	is	egg	rich	and	has	35	egg
yolks	to	a	kilo	(2.2	pounds)	of	flour.	You	can	get	them	in	there,	it	is	crazy!	The	pasta	looks
like	a	sunset.	On	the	pasta,	I	would	first	put	butter	barely	scented	with	sage,	before
shaving	the	truffles	on	top.

Nebbiolo.	Beef	cheeks	braised	in	Nebbiolo	[wine].	To	keep	it	simple,	we	serve	roasted
turnips	and	the	reduced	sauce	with	pomegranate	seeds	and	that’s	it.	We	braise	our	cheeks
for	seven	and	a	half	hours.	Most	braised	dishes	go	four	hours,	but	not	beef	cheeks	—
anything	less,	and	they	are	[still	tough].

Anchovies.	I	love	a	really	acidic	anchovy	vinaigrette	for	a	bread	salad.	Anchovies	with

roasted	garlic	are	like	butter	at	this	restaurant;	they	go	in	lots	of	dishes.	We	put	them	in
lamb,	we	put	them	in	between	potatoes	with	chicken	stock	for	a	gratin.	We	love	them.	I	like
anchovies	with	sage	on	each	side	deep	fried	for	an	appetizer.	We	cook	anchovies	in	olive
oil	with	a	little	butter	until	they	get	toasty,	throw	in	onions	to	caramelize,	and	serve	this	with


fish.

Hazelnuts.	Chocolate	and	hazelnut	is	the	perfect	combination	so	we	make	gianduja
and	put	it	inside	crepes	and	warm	them	and	put	chestnut	honey	on	top.	Most	of	the	time
hazelnuts	end	up	in	salad	or	ground	for	a	final	dusting	for	a	pasta.	Beet	pasta	that	looks	like
candy	wrappers	is	served	on	top	of	a	warm	plate	that	has	just	been	smeared	with

Japanese	cuisine	is	very	simple.	We	don’t	mix	too	many	ingredients	together.	One	of	the	main	ingredients
we	use	in	Japanese	cooking	is	soy	sauce,	for	both	its	saltiness	and	umami.	Soy	sauce	is	very	complex:	It
takes	months	and	months	to	make	it.	Same	for	the	dried	bonito	used	to	make	dashi,	our	Japanese	broth.	So

Kohlrabi	is	an	underrated	vegetable.	I	admit	it	has	not	always	been	one	of	my	favorites,	but	it	has	grown
on	me	over	the	years.	Now,	I	love	it.	I	can’t	precisely	place	its	flavor,	which	is	somewhere	between	a
turnip,	radish,	and	cauliflower.	But	it	tastes	great	and	is	really	versatile.	You	can	grill	it,	roast	it,	glaze	it
like	a	carrot,	or	make	a	gratin	out	of	it	with	potatoes.	We	have	even	grated	it	and	made	a	rémoulade	ouof
it	like	you	would	with	a	celery	root.	But	the	best	way	to	enjoy	kohlrabi	is	grilled,	roasted,	and	drizzled
with	olive	oil	and	sea	salt.	That	is	my	favorite!

LAMB	—	IN	GENERAL

Season:	spring
Taste:	sweet,	astringent
Function:	heating
Weight:	heavy
Volume:	moderate–loud
Techniques:	braise	(esp.	shanks),	grill	(esp.	leg),	roast	(esp.	leg),	stew	(esp.	shoulder)
Tips:	Cloves	add	richness	to	the	flavor	of	lamb.

Our	signature	wine-marinated	lamb	popsicles	in	fenugreek	cream	curry	on	spinach	potatoes	dish	is	bare
rugged	simplicity.	You	have	rack	of	lamb	that	has	been	cooked	just	a	few	minutes.	Then	you	have	a	simple
sauce	that	is	essentially	just	cream	and	garlic	—	and	you	can	taste	all	three.	We	add	some	green	fenugreek
that	gives	an	earthiness	to	the	dish	and	takes	it	to	a	whole	new	level.	It	is	incredibly	simple.	It	is	a	dish
about	technique	because	if	the	garlic	is	cooked	too	long,	it	gets	bitter.	Or	if	you	add	too	much	fenugreek,	it
gets	bitter	and	overpowers	the	cream.	But	in	the	right	proportions,	it	is	perfect.

I	work	with	a	local	lamb	farmer	in	the	Willamette	Valley	who	has	true	spring	lamb	in	the	spring.	We	have
a	spit	and	every	Friday	night	we	roast	a	whole	lamb.	I	am	a	big	fan	of	lamb	shoulder.	It	can	take	a	beating
and	in	the	end	come	out	glorious	tasting!	There	is	an	old	French	technique	where	they	cook	ham	in	hay.
The	hay	is	submerged	in	water;	then	they	put	the	ham	on	it	to	cook.	It	is	amazing.	We	adapted	this
technique	to	the	lamb.	We	had	our	farmer	collect	the	hay	and	grass	in	the	field	where	the	lamb	grazed	with
the	thinking	that	this	is	what	the	lamb	actually	ate.	We	then	dry	the	hay	by	letting	it	sit	out	overnight	on	a
tray,	so	it	becomes	really	butterscotchy	and	barnyardy.	You	can	use	any	hay	for	this	technique	but	I’m	just
a	purist.

We	brine	a	boneless	shoulder	of	lamb	for	24	hours	in	a	brining	solution	of	1	cup	of	salt	and	1⁄cup	of


sugar	in	a	gallon	of	water,	[adding]	some	peppercorns,	bay	leaf,	a	couple	of	cardamom	pods,	a	cinnamon
stick,	and	cumin.	The	brine	is	brought	to	a	boil,	cooled	down,	and	the	lamb	goes	in.	After	the	brining	we
rub	the	lamb	with	garlic	and	summer	savory	and	tie	it	up	into	a	log	and	put	it	on	the	bed	of	hay,	drizzle	it
with	white	wine,	cover	it,	and	put	it	in	the	oven.	It	is	nature	going	back	on	itself.	The	lamb	ate	the	hay,	the
hay	makes	the	lamb	taste	better.	When	it’s	cooked,	the	flavors	are	intense	but	pleasant	and	it	becomes
something	else.	When	lavender	is	in	season,	I’ll	throw	some	in	the	hay	as	well	and	it	is	delicious.

With	the	lamb	I	like	to	serve	a	stuffed	tomato	Provençal	[typically	a	combination	of	basil,	bread
crumbs,	garlic,	olive	oil].	You	want	to	serve	something	simple.	You	could	also	serve	a	crushed	potato
with	savory	and	olive	oil	or	a	medley	of	vegetables.

LEMONS

Season:	year-round
Taste:	sour
Weight:	light

We	have	lemon	juice	right	next	to	the	salt	when	we	cook.	Acid	is	the	most	important	aspect	of	how	a	dish
tastes	—	whether	it	is	there	as	subtle	punctuation	or	an	exclamation	point!
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

Lemon	zest	adds	a	totally	different	dynamic	than	lemon	juice.	If	you	are	making	an	apple	crisp,	if	you
added	a	teaspoon	of	zest	it	would	taste	very	different	than	if	you	added	lemon	juice.	The	juice	would
make	it	taste	tart,	whereas	the	zest	would	actually	add	a	lemon	flavor	component	to	it.	For	ice	cream,
custards,	and	tarts,	use	lemon	juice.	But	if	you	are	going	to	combine	lemon	with	other	flavors,	that’s	when
you	use	zest.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Use	lemon	juice	when	you	want	the	acid	and	lemony	flavor	of	the	juice.	If	you	want	the	perfume	of	the
lemon,	use	the	zest	because	the	skin	is	where	you	get	the	essential	oils.	I	use	more	lemon	and	orange	than
vanilla	in	my	cooking	because	they	are	more	prevalent	in	Italy	and	in	Italian	cooking,	and	a	flavor	profile
that	people	recognize	as	Italian.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Lemon	can	be	used	by	itself	or	with	other	ingredients	because	it	enhances	so	many	flavors.	An	orange	can
be	a	little	too	mellow,	but	lemon	makes	flavors	much	brighter.	Lemon	is	an	underlying	flavor	as	much	as
the	star.	If	there	is	one	fruit	you	had	to	always	have	on	hand	as	a	basic	staple,	it	is	lemon.

We	churn	through	preserved	lemons!	In	the	middle	of	the	summer,	we	buy	cases	so	that	we	can	age	them
eight	months	before	we	use	them.	After	six	months,	they	are	great.	After	eight	months	or	a	year,	you	see
God.	They	become	incredible	just	by	waiting	those	extra	few	months.	I	make	preserved	lemons	by	feel.	I
primarily	use	salt	and	will	add	some	cinnamon,	clove,	nigella,	a	tiny,	tiny	bit	of	saffron,	and	then	just	tuck
them	away	in	the	refrigerator.	If	I	wasn’t	so	greedy,	I	would	give	them	away,	but	we	are	talking	a	year	of
my	life	here!
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

When	you	are	using	different	kinds	of	lemons,	you	need	to	treat	them	as	different	things.	A	Meyer	lemon
is	different	from	a	regular	lemon.	If	you	are	using	a	Meyer	lemon,	you	may	want	the	perfume,	aroma,	and
subtlety	of	it.	Yet	when	you	taste	it,	you	may	want	to	add	a	touch	of	regular	lemon	to	give	it	a	little	more
acidity	and	a	little	kick.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

We	get	a	lot	of	Meyer	lemons	in	during	the	season,	and	they	have	a	lovely	sweet-orangey	lemon	flavor.
But	there	are	times	that	they	are	simply	too	sweet	and	we	have	to	either	add	regular	lemon	or	some	lime
to	balance	the	Meyer	lemon.

I	love	lobster:	poached,	roasted,	or	grilled.	I	like	mayonnaise	or	a	vinaigrette	with	my	lobster	much	more
than	butter	with	lobster.	In	the	summertime,	I	like	it	with	small	potatoes	and	corn.	I	really	like	it	with
cilantro.

For	my	dish	Roasted	Maine	Lobster	in	“Folly	of	Herbs”	with	Baby	Fennel	and	Salsify,	I	wanted	to	do
something	different	with	lobster	besides	a	lobster	sauce.	I	make	a	“tea”	of	dried	herbs:	thyme,	rosemary,
fennel	seeds,	oregano,	sage,	mint,	and	tarragon.	This	is	boiled	and	strained,	then	gets	a	dash	of	Ricard
[also	known	as	Pernod,	an	anise-flavored	liquor].	The	lobster	gets	finished	with	fresh	parsley,	mint,	and
fresh	oregano.	I	chose	these	two	vegetables	because	salsify	is	underused	and	underappreciated.	I	don’t
blanch	my	salsify	in	water	because	when	you	do,	the	flavor	stays	in	the	water.	I	roast	them	and	caramelize
them	a	little	bit,	then	deglaze	with	just	a	little	water	with	a	sprig	of	thyme	and	a	bay	leaf.	Baby	fennel	is
good	because	it	plays	off	the	Ricard	and	fennel.	I	quickly	blanch	the	fennel	and	then	caramelize	it.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Cooked	lobster	meat	blends	well	with	mayonnaise,	but	I	don’t	think	I’d	use	it	with	raw	lobster	—	I’d	use
soy	sauce	instead.

and	lovage	is	celery-like.	It’s	funny:	I	find	nettles	without	lovage	are	kind	of	flat	tasting.	I	will	use	this

—	LISSA	DOUMANI,	TERRA	(ST.	HELENA,	CALIFORNIA)

Macadamia	nuts	are	buttery,	rich	nuts.	I	will	even	pair	them	with	sea	scallops,	which	also	have	a
richness	to	them.	The	macadamia	nuts	don’t	overwhelm	the	scallops	and	I	put	them	in	the	dish	slightly
chopped	—	otherwise,	the	texture	of	the	nut	would	be	too	chewy.	We	use	macadamia	nuts	on	one	of	the
simplest	yet	most	popular	dishes	on	our	menu	—	our	jumbo	lump	crab	cake	with	grilled	asparagus	and
toasted	macadamia	nuts.	Our	crab	cake	is	the	only	recipe	we	won’t	give	out.	It	contains	no	herbs	or
spices.	The	only	thing	that	goes	in	our	crab	cake	is	crab,	salt,	pepper,	panko	[Japanese	bread	crumbs],
and	a	little	mayonnaise	to	hold	them	together.	You	are	the	first	people	to	get	this	recipe!

I	typically	use	maple	syrup	with	nuts,	like	in	a	pecan	pie.	I	will	replace	the	dark	corn	syrup	in	the	recipe
with	maple	syrup	instead.	It	is	always	important	to	use	a	very	good	quality	[e.g.,	Vermont	or	Canadian]
maple	syrup.	If	you	are	working	with	syrup	and	sugar,	you	need	to	be	careful	because	the	combination	of
dark	brown	sugar	with	maple	syrup	can	become	very	intense.

When	planning	a	menu,	pick	the	dessert	or	the	entrée	first	and	have	the	other	one	match	it,	in	terms	of
style	and	preparation.	If	you	are	doing	an	entrée	that	requires	last-minute	time	in	the	kitchen,	don’t	serve	a
dessert	that	requires	last-minute	time	as	well.	If	you	have	a	main	course	that	takes	last-minute	work,	serve
a	dessert	that	can	be	made	a	day	ahead	—	or	if	your	dessert	is	what	needs	last-minute	attention,	serve	it
after	a	stew	or	lasagna.	When	deciding	what	to	make,	remember:	The	heavier	the	main	course,	the	lighter
the	dessert	should	be,	or	vice	versa.	I	was	recently	going	through	some	of	my	earlier	books	and	was
shocked	when	I	looked	at	the	recipes.	One	recipe	for	a	chocolate	cake	that	we	served	at	Stars	was	served
in	big	wedges.	I	was	amazed	we	used	to	serve	such	a	huge	portion!	People	can’t	eat	like	that	anymore.	At
the	same	time,	the	cake	is	so	good	I	still	want	to	serve	it	so	I	work	backward.	I	will	serve	a	chicken	or
something	else	light	for	the	main	course,	not	a	prime	rib	of	beef.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Creating	new	dishes	has	to	be	more	than	simply	intensifying	flavors	for	dishes.	In	terms	of	visual
presentation,	we	are	shifting	into	a	new	direction	where	the	food	looks	like	one	thing,	but	is	really
something	else.	That	adds	an	extra	element	of	challenge	for	us.	An	example	of	this	would	be	a	[Mexican-
inspired]	nacho	dish	we	just	created.	You	get	something	that	looks	like	chips,	sour	cream,	salsa	verde,
and	grated	cheese.	The	cheese	is	actually	grated	from	saffron	ice	cream	that	we	have	thrown	into	liquid
nitrogen,	that	is	put	into	a	food	processor	grater.	The	salsa	verde	is	made	from	kiwi,	mint	puree,	and
epozote	to	give	it	a	little	twist.	The	sour	cream	is	a	yuzu	crème	fraîche.	The	chips	are	made	from	pureed
corn	tortilla	chips	that	have	been	sweetened	with	powdered	sugar,	then	pasted	into	triangles	and	deep
fried.	So	you	get	something	that	looks	like	nachos,	but	tastes	completely	different.	So	we	are	taking	a
visual	aspect	of	something	you	are	comfortable	with	and	serving	it	at	the	end	of	a	twenty-course	meal.

MINT	—	IN	GENERAL

Season:	spring–autumn
Taste:	sweet
Function:	cooling
Weight:	light
Volume:	quiet–moderate
Tips:	Mint	generally	refers	to	spearmint.


Mint	suggests	“false	coolness”	and	adds	a	note	of	freshness	to	dishes.

With	mint,	applemint	is	mild,	while	peppermint	is	strong.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

I	was	actually	brought	up	in	the	school	of	thought	that	put	a	sprig	of	mint	on	every	dessert.	I	am	nothat
guy	anymore.	I	have	a	saying	—	“NFG”	—	which	stands	for	two	things	at	once:	“nonfunctional	garnishes”
are	“no	fucking	good.”	If	something	doesn’t	make	sense	to	the	dish,	it	won’t	be	there.	I	hate	ordering	lamb
and	seeing	a	huge	bunch	of	rosemary	alongside	it.	Put	it	in	the	dish	—	let	me	taste	it!
—	JOHNNY	IUZZINI,	JEAN	GEORGES	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	mint	flavor,	but	some	cooks	started	throwing	mint	on	desserts	just	because	they	liked	the	color	of	it.
If	you	have	a	gorgeous	strawberry	shortcake	and	add	some	mint	to	it,	one	of	two	things	will	happen:	1)
Either	you	don’t	eat	it,	so	what’s	the	point	of	putting	it	on	the	plate	in	the	first	place,	or	2)	If	you	doeat	it,
that	one	mint	leaf	will	completely	change	the	balance	of	the	dessert.	If	you	have	a	lemon	tart	that	is	mostly
perfectly	balanced	lemon	curd	with	a	little	whipped	cream	and	you	add	a	mint	leaf	to	the	dessert,	the	leaf
will	play	havoc	with	that	balance.	So	don’t	throw	mint	on	a	plate	haphazardly,	or	you’ll	throw	off	the
balance	of	the	entire	dessert.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

The	first	place	I	think	of	with	mint	is	Morocco.	From	there,	it	is	the	Middle	East.	Mint	and	lamb	is	such	a
natural	combination,	as	is	mint	and	yogurt.
—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	don’t	use	mint	very	much,	but	I	have	a	serious	thing	for	black	peppermint!	You	will	see	it	in	one	form	or
another	on	my	menu.	I	go	to	the	farmers’	market	twice	a	week	and	use	it	all	summer.	It	is	great	with
berries.	It	works	best	with	something	light	like	an	infusion	or	granita.	Last	summer,	we	made	a	tangy
lychee	gelée	that	was	served	under	oven-roasted	Tristar	strawberries	tossed	lightly	with	balsamic
vinegar.	On	top	of	the	strawberries,	we	scooped	the	black	peppermint	sorbet.

Weight:	medium–heavy
Volume:	quiet–moderate	(depending	on	light	or	dark	miso)
Techniques:	marinades,	sauces,	soups
beef
chicken

I	like	to	add	miso	to	purees	because	it	adds	a	rich,	buttery	flavor	and	a	rich	texture.	I	will	serve	broiled
oysters	topped	with	a	puree	of	miso,	pineapple,	and	serrano	chile.	I	am	working	on	miso-avocado	puree
as	well.	It	is	delicious,	but	I	just	haven’t	found	the	right	dish	for	it	yet.	I	am	also	working	with	miso-
huitlacoche	soup	with	tofu,	mushrooms,	or	corn.
—	KATSUYA	FUKUSHIMA,	MINIBAR	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	love	miso.	I	went	to	a	Japanese	restaurant	and	loved	the	miso	soup.	I	realized	that	it	would	give	more
flavor	than	chicken	broth	to	my	onion	soup.	So	now	I	make	a	miso	broth	the	night	before,	let	it	sit	and
separate,	and	use	the	broth	for	my	onion	soup.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	will	use	several	different	misos,	depending	on	the	purpose.	I	might	use	saikyo,	a	light,	yellow,	sweet
miso,	in	marinades	or	with	lighter	fish	like	sweet	shrimp	and	scallops	that	would	be	overwhelmed	by


dark	miso.	Barley	miso	is	a	distinctive	strong,	sweet	miso	that	I’ll	use	with	nigiri	with	baby	squid	and
shiso.	I’ll	use	wheat	miso	with	foie	gras.	Sometimes	I’ll	even	mix	misos.

Vitaly	Paley	of	Paley’s	Place	in	Portland,	Oregon,	on	Cooking
with	Mushrooms

Mushrooms	Year-Round
Spring.	This	is	the	start	of	the	morel	season.	One	of	the	reasons	I	came	to	work	in	Oregon
was	one	day	I	was	working	in	a	kitchen	in	France	and	a	box	of	morels	arrived	with	a	tag	on
it	that	said	“Oregon.”

Summer.	The	morels	dwindle	away,	and	we	get	a	brief	stint	of	porcini/cepes.	Late

summer	is	golden	and	white	chanterelle	season.

Fall.	The	porcini	come	back	and	we	also	get	in	matsutake	mushrooms	as	well.	We	have

[Pacific	Northwest]	black	and	white	truffles	here	and	the	season	starts	in	November.	They
are	pretty	flavorful	but	it	is	important	to	realize	they	are	different	from	European	truffles	—
not	to	mention	a	lot	less	expensive.

I’m	not	a	big	fan	of	cultivated	mushrooms	but	I	do	like	a	few.	King	oyster	or	trumpet
royal	are	the	same	mushroom	and	it	is	one	of	my	favorites.	Portobellos	are	also	good,
though	they	are	a	little	‘70s.

I	am	suspicious	of	some	dried	mushrooms	you	find	in	the	supermarket	only	because

you	don’t	know	how	old	they	are	and	how	much	flavor	they	will	have.

Buying	and	Cleaning	Mushrooms
When	it	comes	to	mushrooms,	every	kind	needs	to	be	well	cleaned	because	there	is
nothing	worse	than	getting	a	mouthful	of	grit.	I	wash	them	all	by	soaking	them	in	a	bowl	of
water	and	pulling	them	out.	The	key	to	remember	is	that	you	want	to	use	mushrooms	soon
after	washing	them.	Don’t	wash	them	a	day	ahead.

For	morel	mushrooms,	you	need	to	know	how	to	cook	them,	and	slicing	them	up	fresh

and	throwing	them	in	a	pan	is	not	it.	It	is	very	important	to	clean	them	and	I	recommend
blanching	them.	Fill	a	pot	with	cold	water,	toss	in	a	handful	of	salt	and	then	the	mushrooms.
Bring	the	pot	to	a	boil,	scoop	out	the	mushrooms,	spread	them	out,	and	lightly	squeeze
them	dry.	As	you	dry	them,	take	a	good	look	at	them	to	make	sure	they	are	free	of	twigs
and	such.

Seasoning	Mushrooms
When	it	comes	to	seasoning	mushrooms,	savory	works	across	the	board.	The	seasoning
combination	that	I’ve	used	in	my	kitchen	from	day	one	is	a	raw	parsley	and	garlic
combination	that	in	French	is	called	persillade.	After	the	mushrooms	have	been	sautéed	in
butter	or	olive	oil,	at	the	last	second	you	toss	in	this	combination	with	a	pinch	of	salt.	That	is
all	a	mushroom	needs	most	of	the	time!

If	you	are	roasting	porcini	or	king	oyster	mushrooms,	roast	them	on	a	bed	of	savory	or

thyme	for	extra	flavor.

Good	cooking	transcends	all	cultures.	You	can	take	inspiration	from	all	around	the	world	and	apply	it	to
what	you	are	cooking	without	making	it	“fusion.”	In	some	cases,	you	can	even	take	a	classic	and	make	it
taste	better.	I	worked	with	Floyd	Cardoz	[chef	of	the	Indian	restaurant	Tabla	in	New	York	City]	and
learned	a	lot	about	Indian	spicing	and	technique	from	him.	One	technique	was	turka,	which	is	where	you
fry	spices	in	oil	or	ghee	[Indian	clarified	butter]	until	they	pop.	It	really	opens	up	the	flavor	of	the	spices.
I	use	this	cross-cultural	technique	when	making	a	veal	dish	with	a	great	mustard	sauce,	which	is	a
classic	French	dish,	and	the	result	is	not	a	fusion	dish:	Take	black,	yellow,	and	red	mustard	seeds	and
toast	them	in	butter	or	olive	oil	until	they	pop;	then	add	some	shallots	and	vermouth	and	reduce	it.	Then,
add	veal	stock	with	a	splash	of	cream	and	Dijon	mustard.	The	result	is	a	very	complex	sauce	with	a	much
deeper	flavor,	versus	simply	combining	some	cream	and	mustard	together	in	the	pan.

NUTS	—	IN	GENERAL	(See	also	Pecans,	Walnuts,	etc.)

Weight:	heavy
Volume:	moderate	(varies	by	nut)
Tips:	Always	toast	nuts	before	using	to	enhance	flavor	and	texture.

I	love	nuts,	and	put	them	in	everything.	I	find	that	almost	all	nuts	pair	well	with	a	lot	of	different	things.
When	I	am	creating	a	dessert,	I	will	choose	my	nuts	geographically.	For	example,	if	I	am	making	a
Sicilian	dessert,	I’ll	use	pistachios	because	that	is	the	nut	they	would	use	[in	Sicily].
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Marcel	Desaulniers	of	The	Trellis	in	Williamsburg,	Virginia,
on	Nuts
We	use	a	great	deal	of	nuts	at	the	restaurant.	On	our	fall	menu,	we	have	nuts	in	six	out	of
ten	entrées.	Using	nuts	has	always	been	one	of	my	hallmarks	in	terms	of	adding	texture
to	everything	from	a	salad	or	soup	to	entrées	and	desserts.	This	philosophy	hasn’t
changed	much	since	1987	when	I	opened.	I	can’t	think	of	a	nut	that	doesn’t,	in	essence,
work	in	both	sweet	and	savory	dishes.

The	quality	of	chopped	nuts	can	never	compare	with	the	quality	of	whole	nuts.	In	26	years,	we	have	never
bought	chopped	pecans	because	the	quality	is	so	different,	despite	the	fact	that	it	would	be	a	lot	less
expensive.

I	recommend	simply	chopping	by	hand	or,	in	the	case	of	something	like	a	pecan,	breaking	it	with	your
fingers.	Pecans	have	so	much	moisture	that	if	you	chop	them,	you	lose	what	is	special	about	their	texture.
People	tend	to	put	nuts	into	the	food	processor	and	the	next	thing	you	know,	you	have	powder	and	not
pieces.

We	always	toast	our	nuts,	100	percent	of	the	time.	Nuts	absorb	a	lot	of	moisture,	so	by	toasting	them
you	dry	them	out	and	heighten	the	flavor.	You	do	need	to	be	careful,	because	they	burn	so	easily.	Slower
roasting	is	better.	With	a	nut	like	a	cashew,	you	want	to	roast	them	at	325	degrees	to	get	them	to	be	a	nice,
golden	brown.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

Always	toast	nuts	to	bring	up	the	flavor.	If	you	don’t	toast	the	nuts	before	adding	them	to	a	dish,	they	tend
to	come	out	soggy	when	the	dish	is	done.	The	one	exception	would	be	if	they	are	going	on	top	of	a	tart
going	into	the	oven,	because	then	they	would	be	overtoasted.

Nuts	work	great	in	adding	texture,	especially	to	creamy	and/or	moussey	desserts.	The	other	way	to

balance	out	richness	is	with	some	phyllo	dough.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Juicing	nuts	is	the	new	thing	we	are	doing.	We’ll	juice	almonds,	hazelnuts,	and	—	best	of	all	—	pine	nuts,
which	comes	out	like	pine	nut	butter.	Juicing	pine	nuts	is	better	than	grinding	them,	because	it	pulverizes
their	fat.	We	put	that	on	some	local	green	beans	with	preserved	lemon	zest,	to	serve	with	spring	onions
with	lamb.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)


Lavender	works	well	with	all	sorts	of	nuts,	including	almonds,	hazelnuts,	pistachios,	and	walnuts.	The
one	nut	it	doesn’t	work	well	with	is	chestnuts.

I	like	almond	oil	with	asparagus	salad.
—	DANIEL	HUMM,	ELEVEN	MADISON	PARK	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I’ll	poach	everything	from	saddle	of	rabbit	to	guinea	fowl	to	fish	—	from	sturgeon,	which	holds	up	nicely,
to	New	Zealand	snapper	to	John	Dory	—	in	avocado	oil.	It	gives	an	incredible	texture	and	depth	of
flavor.	I	also	like	it	with	vegetarian	dishes.	I	use	it	in	dressings,	and	it	seems	to	hold	an	emulsion	really
well.	It	has	a	nice	affinity	with	tomato;	I	have	made	tomato	water	with	chardonnay	vinegar	and	avocado
oil,	and	it	makes	beautiful	light	dressing.	It	also	goes	well	with	citrus	like	lemon,	lime,	or	orange.	Just
like	you	like	to	squeeze	some	citrus	over	avocado,	avocado	oil	works	the	same	way	in	reverse.


—	BRAD	FARMERIE,	PUBLIC	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Hazelnut	oil	gets	mixed	with	cider	vinegar;	that	is	a	great	natural	marriage.	This	gets	tossed	in	our	baby
winter	spinach	with	mixed	herbs	and	frisée	salad.	The	toasted	nut	quality	mixes	well	with	bitter	greens.
—	MICHAEL	ANTHONY,	GRAMERCY	TAVERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Hazelnut	oil	is	a	wonderful	autumn	oil.	We	will	use	it	in	a	dark	balsamic	vinaigrette	served	with	squab.
It	is	also	very	good	with	broccoli.	If	you	make	a	broccoli	soup,	use	this	along	with	toasted	hazelnuts.	It	is
a	delicious	combination.

Endive	and	Mushroom	Salad,	Blue	Cheese,	Spicy	Pecans,	White	Balsamic–White	Truffle
Vinaigrette
—	Monica	Pope,	T’afia	(Houston)

Truffle	oil	is	one	of	those	ingredients	that	really	gets	overused,	so	one	day	I	decided	that	I	wanted	to	do
truffle	oil	right.	We	make	a	dressing	of	truffle	oil,	white	balsamic	vinegar,	and	whole	grain	mustard.	We
toss	it	over	endive,	crumbled	blue	cheese,	spicy	pecans,	and	raw	cremini	mushrooms.	You	just	can’t	stop
eating	it!
—	MONICA	POPE,	T’AFIA	(HOUSTON)

On	Selecting	the	Right	Oil

Your	choice	of	olive	oil	always	depends	on	what	you	are	using	it	for.	In	general,	you	don’t	want	an	oil
that	is	super-assertive,	green,	or	peppery.	You	want	a	good	olive	flavor.	I	use	a	100	percent	Italian	blend.
It	is	silly	to	cook	with	100	percent	extra-virgin	olive	oil	if	you	are	just	sautéing	something.	If	the	oil	is
going	to	stay	in	what	you	are	making,	like	a	sauce,	then	start	with	extra-virgin	olive	oil.	When	I	make	a
tomato	sauce,	that	is	what	I	am	starting	with.

If	you	are	finishing	a	dish,	that	is	also	when	you	would	use	an	assertive,	more	full-flavored	oil.	I	also
like	to	use	nut	oils,	especially	those	made	by	Jean	Leblanc.	They	are	insane;	his	oils	are	so	good	that	after
you	taste	them,	nothing	else	will	do!	I	especially	like	to	use	nut	oils	in	the	fall.	I	use	walnut	oil	dressing
on	salads,	especially	those	salads	that	accompany	meat.	If	you	make	a	foie	gras	dish	with	apples	and
endive,	an	addition	of	walnut	oil	would	be	great.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Olive	oil	comes	in	a	wide	variety	of	flavors	and	strengths	even	from	the	same	region,	much	like	wine:

•	I	use	a	heavier	(e.g.,	Puglian,	Umbrian,	Sicilian)	olive	oil	on	bigger-flavored	dishes.	A	strong	olive
oil	goes	well	on	bean	puree	or	a	strong	vegetable	like	dandelion	greens.	In	the	United	States,	you


would	put	a	barbecue	sauce	on	a	grilled	meat;	in	Italy,	you	would	use	a	strong	olive	oil.

•	I	use	a	lighter	(e.g.,	Ligurian,	Tuscan)	olive	oil	on	lighter	meats	like	veal	or	fish	dishes	and	pastas.
A	Ligurian	olive	is	full	and	bright	and	is	great	on	a	lighter	dish.
—	ODETTE	FADA,	SAN	DOMENICO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

•	I	like	to	use	single	varietal	olive	oil	from	Australia	and	New	Zealand.	Australian	olive	oils	can	be
like	their	wines:	big,	pungent,	and	spicy.	New	Zealand	oils	have	a	little	more	depth	of	flavor	and
green	grassiness.

The	onion	family	is	the	basis	for	every	cuisine	I	can	think	of.	Of	course,	Asian	cuisines	use	more	green
onions	and	garlic,	while	the	French	use	more	shallots	and	garlic,	but	it’s	the	onion	family	providing	the
foundation.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

You	can’t	cook	without	onions.	There	is	not	a	single	thing	you	can	do	without	onions.	There	are	so	many
things	made	with	onions	that	when	people	come	in	to	our	restaurant	and	say	that	they	are	allergic	to
onions,	I	say,	“No,	you	are	not	—	it	is	impossible.	You	just	don’t	like	onions.”	People	eat	onions	all	the
time	and	just	don’t	know	it.	I	remember	having	a	conversation	with	[the	artist]	Jasper	Johns,	with	him
saying,	“If	truffles	and	onions	cost	the	same	amount	of	money,	you	would	obviously	choose	an	onion.	You
don’t	need	truffles;	you	do	need	onions.”
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	roast	onions	a	long,	long	time	and	use	them	to	add	a	meaty	flavor	to	soups.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Your	cooking	technique	alters	your	flavors	a	great	deal.	If	you	put	a	lot	of	onions	in	your	curry	but	don’t
sauté	them	enough	first,	you	will	get	a	sweet	flavor.	If	you	sauté	the	onions	until	they	are	almost	burnt	but
not	quite,	your	curry	will	have	more	of	a	roasted-toasted	flavor.

We	use	lots	of	smoked	paprika,	but	need	to	be	careful	because	it	can	be	really	strong.	I	like	to	finish	our
fried	chickpeas	with	this	because	it	makes	them	taste	like	they	just	jumped	out	of	the	fire!	We	also	like	to
mix	our	paprikas	together,	typically	in	equal	proportions	of	sweet,	hot,	and	smoked.	Smoked	paprika	is
primarily	smoky	and	doesn’t	have	a	lot	of	other	flavors.	So	if	you	combine	it	with	a	vibrant	sweet
paprika,	you’ll	get	a	more	rounded	pepper	flavor.	Paprika	is	also	very	regional.	In	the	south	[of	Spain]
where	it	gets	sunshine	and	heat,	you	see	more	smoked	paprika,	but	in	the	north	where	it	is	colder	and
rainy,	they	are	not	into	the	heat.

The	Spanish	use	parsley	stems	for	cooking,	and	fresh	as	a	garnish	before	serving.	When	you	make	rice	or
beans,	you	would	put	a	stem	in.	To	me,	parsley	added	to	fish	or	shellfish	makes	the	dish	tastes	more
“marine,”	as	opposed	to	earthy.	I	love	salsa	verde,	which	is	a	sauce	made	with	basically	a	ton	of	parsley,
garlic,	and	some	kind	of	juice	like	clam	juice.	It’s	wonderful	served	with	fish.

—	ALEXANDRA	RAIJ,	TÍA	POL	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

People	do	not	understand	parsley;	they	think	it	is	green	specks.	But	it	is	wonderful	with	fish.	If	you	make
a	straight-up	linguini	with	clam	sauce,	you	want	a	big	handful	of	chopped	parsley	in	there	—	not	for	the
appearance,	but	for	the	taste.	It	is	an	important	component	in	a	lot	of	dishes	and	needs	to	be	there.	Itcan
also	be	used	as	a	sauce	all	on	its	own.	If	you	sprinkle	it	on	a	steak,	it	will	not	have	the	impact	that	it
would	on	fish.	On	the	other	hand,	if	you	make	a	Maître	d’hôtel	butter	[butter	flavored	with	lemon	juice
and	parsley]	and	put	it	on	the	steak,	the	parsley	has	a	role	there.	On	vegetables,	if	you	make	glazed	carrots
or	pearl	onions	or	a	stew	with	lots	of	vegetables,	parsley	stirred	in	at	the	last	moment	is	good	stuff.	As	for
my	choice	of	parsley,	I	always	use	flat	Italian-style	parsley.

—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Salsa	verde	is	my	favorite	all-purpose	condiment	at	home.	I	like	it	on	fish,	lamb,	and	steak.	It	is	made


with	anchovy,	garlic,	shallots,	olive	oil,	and	herbs	—	primarily	parsley,	but	also	chervil,	chives,
tarragon,	a	little	bit	of	marjoram,	and	sometimes	a	little	mint	if	I	am	in	the	mood.	I	add	the	acid	at	the	last
moment	so	it	won’t	change	the	color	of	the	herbs,	and	will	choose	between	Banyuls	or	red	wine	vinegar,
or	lemon	juice.	If	I	am	serving	meat,	I	will	use	vinegar;	if	I	am	serving	fish,	I	will	use	lemon.	Even	though
it	changes	color	once	the	acid	is	added,	it	lasts	a	few	days.	It	is	really	good	on	a	piece	of	bread	or	with
some	fresh	farmer’s	cheese	as	a	snack.

Pairing	Pastas	with	Sauces
Which	sauces	pair	best	with	which	pastas?	We	asked	chef	Odette	Fada	of	New	York	City’s
San	Domenico	restaurant.

•	Angel	hair:	In	Italy,	angel	hair	pasta	is	served	to	old	people	who	can’t	chew.	It’s	for	grandparents,
or	for	others	to	eat	when	they	are	sick.	The	problem	with	angel	hair	pasta	is	it’s	so	thin	it’s	hard	to
cook	al	dente,	and	I	like	my	pasta	a	little	chewy.

•	Bow	tie:	Fresh	bow	tie	is	great	when	made	by	hand,	because	it	stays	folded	and	doesn’t	open	into	a
square.	I	like	to	serve	it	with	vegetables	and	tomato-based	sauces.

•	Fettuccine:	This	is	a	flavorful	pasta	and	is	good	with	a	Bolognese	sauce.

•	Fusilli:	I	like	their	[corkscrew]	shape,	but	they	tend	to	break	easily	so	they	are	not	that	attractive
when	you	cook	them	in	a	restaurant	setting.	I	like	them	at	home	in	a	salad	or	with	some	pesto	because
the	pesto	sticks	to	it.

•	Hollow	pasta	[e.g.,	macaroni,	penne,	rigatoni]:	Good	with	sauces	that	have	big	chunks	in	them	so
that	the	sauce	pieces	go	inside	whole.	I	like	to	do	penne	with	fresh	peas	because	the	peas	will	slip
inside,	so	you’ll	sometimes	get	a	little	surprise	when	you’re	chewing.

•	Pappardelle:	This	is	a	strong,	rustic	pasta.	I	like	it	with	rabbit	sauce,	a	ragoût,	or	a	fish	sauce	that
has	some	character.

•	Small	pasta	[e.g.,	rice-,	shell-,	or	star-shaped]:	These	are	good	for	soups	and	brothy	dishes.	For
example,	you	would	use	them	with	a	brothy	fish	dish.

•	Spaghetti:	Everything	goes	with	spaghetti!	It	is	a	pasta	that	sauce	sticks	to.	Everything	from	tomato
sauce	to	pesto	to	pecorino	with	black	pepper	is	great	with	spaghetti.
Or,	if	you’re	starting	with	the	sauce:

•	Carbonara:	Spaghetti	or	bucatini,	you	want	a	pasta	that	the	sauce	will	stick	to.

•	Cream:	Fettuccine,	pappardelle,	or	gnocchi,	since	cream	is	so	rich	you	want	a	strong-flavored
pasta	or,	in	the	last	case,	gnocchi	—	one	that	is	made	with	some	egg	in	it.

•	Game:	Pappardelle	or	fettuccine;	you	want	an	egg-rich	pasta	with	some	flavor.

•	Olive	oil	and	garlic:	Spaghetti.

•	Pesto:	Fusilli.

•	Tomato:	This	works	with	almost	all	pasta	shapes,	from	small	to	large.
I	have	played	with	lots	of	flavored	pasta	doughs.	One	of	my	favorites	is	olive	because	it
holds	its	flavor.	Other	flavors	that	hold	up	well	are	squid	ink	and	saffron.	I	have	also	made	a
pappardelle	with	cocoa	powder	that	I	paired	with	game	sauce	that	worked	great.	If	you
wanted	to	achieve	a	particular	color,	you	could	create	red	pasta	with	beets,	green	pasta


with	spinach,	and	black	pasta	with	squid	ink.

Chef	Odette	Fada	of	New	York’s	San	Domenico	on	Making
Ravioli
I	love	ravioli!	Anything	and	everything	goes	in	my	ravioli	—	I	have	used	everything	from
chestnuts	to	cheese	to	fish,	meat,	and	vegetables.	You	can	vary	the	ravioli	dough	as	well	as
the	stuffing.	For	example,	I	serve	ravioli	stuffed	with	sea	urchin	and	the	dough	is	light	and
made	with	just	flour	and	water.	For	a	stronger	filling	like	lamb,	I	will	use	some	egg	in	the
dough	which	makes	it	bigger	flavored.	One	of	my	favorite	ravioli	stuffings	is	black	truffle	and
pancetta.	The	truffle	provides	a	crunchiness	when	you	bite	into	it.

One	of	the	greatest	ravioli	we	do	dates	back	to	the	chef	for	the	last	king	of	Italy	at	the
beginning	of	the	twentieth	century.	It	is	stuffed	with	spinach,	truffle,	Parmesan	cheese,	and
an	egg	yolk,	and	served	with	butter,	truffle,	and	Parmesan	cheese.	When	the	ravioli	is
cooked,	it	is	served	with	the	yolk	warm	but	not	cooked.	It	is	truly	an	amazing	dish.

In	Italy	during	the	winter,	you	would	typically	have	some	slices	of	sausage	on	top	of	a

plate	of	lentils.	I	decided	to	combine	the	two	into	a	ravioli	dish.	Now,	one	of	my	other
favorite	dishes	is	our	ravioli	stuffed	with	cotechino	[sausage]	and	lentils.	The	lentils	are
cooked	with	rosemary,	garlic,	extra-virgin	olive	oil,	and	prosciutto	skin,	and	go	into	the
ravioli	with	the	sausage,	parsley,	and	Parmesan	cheese.	The	dish	is	finished	with	some
strong	extra-virgin	olive	oil,	parsley,	and	a	crack	of	pepper.

When	I	think	of	the	essence	of	peaches,	it’s	their	smell	—	so	I	think	of	echoing	that	with	the	floralness	of
Moscato	d’Asti.	I’ll	add	acidity,	sweetness,	and	a	little	fat,	such	as	through	crème	fraîche.
—	TONY	LIU,	AUGUST	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	try	not	to	cook	peaches,	or	if	I	do,	only	for	a	short	amount	of	time.	A	peach	pie	never	tastes	asgood	to
me	as	a	blueberry	pie,	because	it	tastes	too	cooked	by	the	time	you	get	it	thick	enough.	So	if	I	get	peaches,
I’ll	chop	them	up	and	put	them	on	a	tart	shell	that	is	already	cooked	instead.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	like	peaches	with	rich,	round	flavors	like	vanilla	and	honey.
—	GINA	DEPALMA,	BABBO	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Japanese	baby	peaches	are	tiny	peaches	about	the	size	of	olives.	We	wanted	to	showcase	the	peaches	and
thought,	What	do	peaches	go	with?	Cream.	We	took	that	one	step	further	and	used	yogurt	instead.	So	we
chose	Greek	yogurt,	paired	it	with	the	peaches,	then	garnished	the	dish	with	Hawaiian	pink	sea	salt,
Greek	olive	oil,	reduced	balsamic	vinegar,	and	micro	mint.	We	turned	the	water	strained	from	the	yogurt


into	“air”	[foam].	This	is	a	dish	that	we	serve	as	a	pre-dessert	and	it	works	well	because	it	is	sweet	and
savory.

Anything	we	put	peanuts	on	sells!	Peanuts	are	associated	with	the	South,	so	there	is	a	regional	appeal.
We	had	a	chicken	breast	with	sugar	snap	peas,	white	radishes,	toasted	peanuts,	basmati	rice,	and	spicy
peanut	sauce.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

Peanuts	are	not	as	versatile	as	other	nuts.	They	have	a	great	flavor	and	are	pretty	generic	so	you	can	use
them	on	a	lot	of	things	and	they	pair	well.	Milk	chocolate	and	peanuts	work	really	well	together.	Peanuts
pair	great	with	bananas,	especially	if	you	cover	the	banana	in	chocolate	and	then	roll	it	in	peanuts	and
freeze	it.

This	salad	has	roasted	pear,	Roquefort	cheese,	lemon,	and	olive	oil	and	is	garnished

with	borage	flowers.	The	sauce	is	burnt	caramel	with	pepper	deglazed	with	Coteaux	du
Layon,	which	is	sweet	but	higher	in	acid	than	Sauternes.	The	caramel	sauce	keeps	you
awake!

Cheese	and	fruit:	Blue	cheese	is	sharp	and	hits	your	palate,	then	the	pear	calms	it

down.

parsley,	and	anise	hyssop.

Salad	greens:	We	use	herbs	in	our	salad	and	this	one	has	fennel,	thyme,	tarragon,

Borage	flowers:	Eating	a	borage	flower	is	like	eating	an	oyster!	It	is	briny.	In	the
summer	when	they	are	in	season,	if	you	taste	a	couple	it	is	reminiscent	of	a	mild	oyster.
—	GABRIEL	KREUTHER,	THE	MODERN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Apples	are	more	popular	than	pears	because	when	you	go	to	the	store,	pears	are	all	hard.	You	buy	them,
bring	them	home,	and	wait	forever	for	them	to	ripen.	You	have	to	have	a	premeditated	use	for	pears.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

I	like	pears	poached	because	I’m	not	fond	of	their	texture.	I	also	make	a	pear	tart	with	pears	poached	in
lemon	zest	and	vanilla,	and	then	combined	with	custard,	honey,	lemon,	and	vanilla.	It	is	paired	with	a
honey	grappa	zabaglione	and	topped	with	grated	Pecorino	Toscano	cheese	grated	over	it	as	if	it	were
pasta.	The	dish	sounds	a	little	crazy	but	all	these	flavors	are	classic	combinations	found	in	Italy.	Pears	are
often	infused	with	grappa	in	the	north	of	Italy.	Pears,	honey,	and	pecorino	is	a	classic	combination	in
Tuscany.	Pecorino	goes	with	every	flavor.	Honey	carries	all	the	flavors	forward.

I	like	white	pepper	with	most	white	fish,	and	black	pepper	with	tuna	and	red	meat.	White	pepper	works
with	halibut	because	it	does	not	overwhelm	the	fish.	Black	pepper	has	a	complex	flavor	and	is	spicy,
which	can	be	distracting.	The	problem	with	many	peppers	like	cayenne	or	chipotle	is	that	they	are	so
strong	they	can	burn.	That	is	not	a	problem	for	me,	but	it	is	for	our	clientele.	We	use	piment	d’Espelette,
which	is	spicy	but	sweet.
—	ERIC	RIPERT,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

You	have	to	be	careful	with	black	pepper	because	it	can	be	a		vehicle	to	add	flavor	—	but	if	misused,	it
will	mask	flavor.	I	might	add	the	tiniest	little	pinch	before	a	dessert	gets	served	to	punch	it	up.	I	use	black
pepper	with	fresh	fruit,	especially	cherries.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

To	me,	tuna	doesn’t	even	taste	like	tuna	anymore	unless	it’s	seared	with	my	pepper	mix	of	toasted	and
ground	black	and	pink	peppercorns,	coriander,	and	star	anise.	The	same	mix	is	also	great	on	beef,	buffalo,
and	venison.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

We	don’t	have	sixteen	types	of	pepper	here;	we	use	a	basic	black	Tellicherry	peppercorn	and	a	little	bit
of	red	pepper	flakes.	I	will	occasionally	go	to	an	Asian	market	to	get	a	pepper	that	has	a	sweet	element	to
it,	as	these	also	tend	to	have	a	fruitiness	to	them	that	works	well	in	braised	dishes.

ago.	I	stuff	them	with	goat	cheese	and	wrap	them	in	Serrano	ham	before	frying	them.	You	get
sweetness	and	spice	from	the	peppers,	saltiness	from	the	ham,	creaminess	from	the	cheese,

similar	to	Mexican	guajillo	peppers.	Chorizero	peppers	are	bittersweet.	Their	pulp	is	used
in	salsa	vizcaina,	which	is	a	red	sauce	made	with	a	lot	of	onions	cooked	down	sweet,	the

Because	of	the	texture	and	unique	flavor	of	a	persimmon,	no	matter	what	you	do	it	will	always	taste	like
persimmon	pudding.	I	decided	two	years	ago	to	stop	trying	to	do	anything	else	with	persimmons.	Why	try
and	reinvent	the	wheel?	To	work	with	persimmons,	you	first	put	them	in	the	freezer	overnight	to	ripen,
then	peel	and	puree	them.	Persimmons	are	pretty	astringent,	so	you	need	to	add	a	lot	of	spices	and	sugar	to
them.	The	combination	of	allspice,	cinnamon,	and	ginger	that	you	see	in	traditional	recipes	is	nice	with
persimmons,	and	adds	an	interesting	complexity	to	the	flavor.

PICKLES

I	lived	in	Japan	for	two	years	where	I	fell	in	love	with	pickles	and	pickling.	For	pickling,	I	use	the
proportions	that	are	common	for	seasoning	Japanese	sushi	rice,	though	I’ll	admit	that	there	might	be	a
sushi	chef	out	there	who	might	disagree	with	me:	9	parts	vinegar	to	5	parts	sugar,	1	part	salt,	and	1	part
water.	Pickles	are	one	of	those	things	I	love	to	have	in	my	pantry	because	they	are	so	fun	to	use	and	make
so	many	things	yummy.	It	is	definitely	one	of	my	tricks	that	I	keep	stashed	away.	I	like	to	pickle	Swiss
chard	stems	with	raw	beets	and	star	anise.	They	are	great	together	and	work	as	a	garnish	on	our	Nantucket
Bay	scallop	dish.

PIMENTON	(See	also	Paprika)

I	don’t	even	like	to	use	the	word	“paprika”	when	referring	to	pimenton.	It	is	not	the	same	as	Hungarian
paprika,	which	is	just	dried	pepper	and	doesn’t	taste	like	anything	else.	The	Spanish	were	the	first	to
plant	peppers.	Our	pimenton	has	the	right	touch	of	sweetness,	bitterness,	and	smoke.	Used	in	a	dish	it
makes	the	dish	a	whole	new	thing.	Sprinkled	on	octopus,	it	is	astonishing.

Pineapple	is	80	to	90	percent	water.	We’ll	freeze	the	pineapple,	then	pull	it	out	and	put	it	in	a	colander,
and	let	the	juice	run	out	of	it	—	which	has	all	the	flavor	of	the	pineapple.	After	pressing	out	all	thjuice,
we’ll	throw	out	the	now-flavorless	pulp,	and	use	just	the	juice.	You	can	do	the	same	with	strawberries	or

—	Patrick	O’Connell,	The	Inn	at	Little	Washington	(Washington,	Virginia)

Pistachios	are	a	distinctively	flavored	nut.	You	need	to	be	sure	that	what	you	pair	with	them	will	stand
up.	They	go	well	with	raspberries	but	not	strawberries	because	the	latter	are	softer	in	flavor.
—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Pistachios	look	great	with	other	nuts	because	you	get	green	and	brown	alongside	each	other.	They	can	be
pretty	mild	so	they	are	less	about	flavor	and	more	about	color	and	texture.	Since	pistachios	are	so	mild	I
like	to	feature	them	solo	or	in	a	large	quantity	so	they	don’t	get	lost.	I	make	a	chocolate	semifreddo	and
there	is	pistachio	in	the	semifreddo,	there	is	pistachio	paste,	they	are	on	the	plate,	and	they	are	in	the
sauce.	They	are	front	and	center.

Flavor	Affinities

What	is	nice	about	pomegranates	is	that	they	are	very	flavorful	but	don’t	have	a	lot	of	sugar	in	them.
They	also	have	a	unique	flavor	that	is	not	like	anything	else.	It	is	one	of	the	few	flavors	that	have	come
around	in	popularity	because	they	have	made	it	easier	to	use	[via	pomegranate	juice,	molasses,	etc.].
Cleaning	them	to	use	just	the	seeds	can	be	a	pain	in	the	neck.	However,	I	use	the	juice	because	it	makes	a
great	sorbet.

You’ll	often	see	what	is	essentially	clam	chowder	[without	the	clams]	used	as	a	sauce:	the	combination	of
pork	—	whether	it’s	bacon,	chorizo,	or	whatever	—	and	thyme,	served	with	potatoes	and	cream.	It	could
be	served	with	something	poached	or	sautéed.	It	is	a	cute	reworking	of	something	that	is	classic.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	like	the	combination	of	pork	with	fruit.	With	a	pork	chop,	fresh	and	dried	figs	or	strawberries	would	all
work.
—	MARCEL	DESAULNIERS,	THE	TRELLIS	(WILLIAMSBURG,	VIRGINIA)

Sauces	often	don’t	do	justice	to	the	meat	they’re	saucing.	For	that	reason,	we	don’t	use	veal	stock	with
pork,	which	hides	the	flavor	of	the	meat.	Instead,	we	want	to	do	everything	we	can	to	emphasize	the
flavor	of	the	pork	itself.	So,	we’ll	roast	the	pork	scraps	and	bones	and	make	a	pork	stock	instead.	In	the
summertime,	to	keep	it	light,	we	won’t	even	add	wine.

I’m	sometimes	inspired	by	looking	back	to	my	childhood	and	the	combinations	of	flavors	I	liked.	I	was	a
pretty	picky	eater	growing	up,	but	I	loved	my	macaroni	and	cheese,	and	bacon	and	eggs.	I	came	up	with	a
take	on	bacon	and	eggs	substituting	pork	belly	for	the	bacon.	I	love	pork	belly	—	it	is	a	poor	man’s	foie
gras,	the	way	it	just	melts	in	your	mouth.	I	make	the	eggs	in	a	double	boiler	that	gives	them	a	creamy
texture,	and	finish	them	with	fresh	herbs.	For	the	belly,	we	grill	it	and	then	braise	it	in	citrus,	champagne
vinegar,	and	veal	stock	for	six	hours.	Then	at	serving,	we	grill	it	again	and	top	it	with	a	“sweet	heat”
sauce	which	is	like	a	barbecue	sauce	with	layers	and	layers	of	flavor.

With	pumpkin	or	even	sweet	potatoes,	the	combination	of	allspice,	cinnamon,	ginger,	and	clove	works
great.	If	you	buy	canned	pumpkin	that	has	spices	already	added,	it	tastes	a	little	off	and	artificial.
Depending	on	how	you	like	your	spices,	you	typically	add	equal	amounts	of	ginger	and	cinnamon	and	less
allspice	and	clove	because	the	last	two	are	very	strong.


—	EMILY	LUCHETTI,	FARALLON	(SAN	FRANCISCO)

Pumpkin	and	butternut	squash	juices	are	great	in	dishes	featuring	[each	respective	vegetable].	What	the
juice	does	is	intensify	their	flavor,	making	the	dishes	taste	more	natural.
—	ANDREW	CARMELLINI,	A	VOCE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

—	BRADFORD	THOMPSON,	MARY	ELAINE’S	AT	THE	PHOENICIAN	(SCOTTSDALE,	ARIZONA)

Pumpkin	and	bay	leaf	together	make	the	pumpkin	taste	even	more	pumpkin-like.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

My	pumpkin	pie	soup	dish	was	inspired	by	walking	through	Whole	Foods	and	seeing	pumpkins.	I	thought,
How	do	I	like	my	pumpkin?	I	like	pumpkin	pie,	and	thought	it	would	actually	make	an	interesting	soup.	I
made	a	pumpkin	soup	and	found	the	soup	to	be	very	savory	with	its	spicing,	and	added	smoked	duck	to	it.
I	wanted	a	contrasting	flavor,	so	I	added	some	sweet	meringue	as	a	garnish.	Then	I	needed	a	contrast	to
the	creaminess,	so	I	put	in	a	piece	of	pie	crust	a	second	before	serving	as	well	as	toasted	pecans	for	even
more	crunch.

A	dish	I	am	really	proud	of	is	our	saddle	of	rabbit	served	with	green	olives,	shallots,	marjoram,	and
fennel	jam.	This	is	a	light	and	beautifully	balanced	dish	that	reminds	me	of	Liguria	[in	Italy].	The	olives
are	salty,	the	marjoram	is	strong,	and	the	fennel	is	sweet.	This	has	been	on	our	menu	for	over	a	year	but	it
took	me	a	few	tries	to	get	right.	I	tried	black	olives,	but	they	were	too	strong.	I	tried	rosemary,	but	it	was
too	earthy.	I	tried	Brussels	sprouts,	but	they	were	a	little	too	bitter	and	didn’t	complement	the	same	way
sweet	fennel	did.	So	though	the	combination	didn’t	work	for	the	saddle,	the	black	olives	and	rosemary	led
me	to	add	some	rabbit	liver	and	stuff	a	whole	boned	rabbit.	That	dish	did	work.	The	two	dishes	were
different	in	the	sense	that	the	saddle	with	the	green	olives	was	a	little	more	sophisticated	while	the	whole
rabbit	was	more	of	a	peasant	dish.	Customers	like	both!

Radicchio	Salad	with	Parmesan	Balsamic	Vinaigrette

There	is	a	time	of	year	when	all	there	seems	to	be	in	the	green	market	is	radishes.	You	get	sick	of	seeing
them	and	they	are	there	for	months.	I	needed	to	create	something	new	and	all	there	was	were	radishes.	So,
I	came	up	with	a	radish	salad	served	with	lobster.	We	blanch	turnip	rounds	and	fold	in	a	little	baby	ginger
to	get	this	wonderfully	peppery	salad.	The	sauce	with	the	lobster	is	a	pistachio	vinaigrette	that	is	bound
by	onion	puree	and	brightened	by	the	juice	that	pickled	the	ginger.	We	finish	the	dish	with	toasted
pistachios	and	add	a	pistachio	oil.	The	pistachio	nut	and	oil	add	an	earthy	quality	and	depth	of	flavor	to
the	dish.

When	working	with	raspberries,	I	will	try	not	to	cook	them	too	much.	The	problem	is	that	often	fresh
raspberries	are	not	that	great.	If	I	am	making	a	sauce,	even	in	the	middle	of	summer	I	will	use	frozen
raspberries.	You	can	use	frozen	fruit	as	long	as	it	doesn’t	have	sugar	or	anything	else	added.	The	fruit	is
picked	in	the	field	when	it	is	ripe	and	frozen	right	away.	So,	the	frozen	raspberries	will	have	better	flavor
than	those	that	have	been	put	in	a	little	carton	and	shipped	across	the	country.	Of	course,	local	farmers’
market	raspberries	are	a	different	story.	If	I	am	making	a	sauce	in	the	summer,	the	frozen	raspberries	will
taste	great.	On	the	other	hand,	you	would	not	use	frozen	raspberries	on	top	of	a	tart.

I	like	to	pair	rhubarb,	caramelized	sugar,	and	blood	orange	juice	—	which	has	more	character	than
orange	juice	—	because	their	seasons	barely	overlap.	I	am	not	a	fan	of	rhubarb	desserts	because	they
always	tend	to	be	one	note	—	either	very	tart,	or	very	sweet	to	make	up	for	the	tartness.	Caramel	works
well	with	rhubarb	because	it	makes	the	rhubarb	not	too	sweet.

Odette	Fada	of	New	York’s	San	Domenico	on	Risotto
I	am	from	Northern	Italy	and	grew	up	eating	risotto.	Back	then,	we	mainly	ate	risotto
Milanese	[i.e.,	saffron	risotto,	traditionally	served	with	osso	buco	or	with	a	mild	pork
sausage	crumbled	in	with	some	rosemary].	We	would	also	put	it	in	soup	—	or	even	just	eat
it	simply	with	some	grated	cheese.

I	love	it	because	it	only	takes	one	pan,	and	it	is	ready	in	20	minutes!	People	think	it
takes	a	long	time	but	if	you	were	to	cook	a	piece	of	fish,	wash	greens,	and	make	a	salad
dressing,	that	would	take	just	as	long.

You	can	make	risotto	with	almost	anything.	I	love	it	with	fruit,	vegetables,	or	fish.	One	of

my	favorite	fruit	risottos	is	a	seasonal	one	with	pears	and	Gorgonzola.	The	pears	give	a
nice,	sweet	crunch	to	the	dish.	I	also	like	making	risotto	with	Prosecco,	strawberries,	and
nettles.

A	classic	combination	in	Italy	in	fall	is	game	with	blueberry	jam	and	mushrooms.	I	have

adapted	this	and	for	over	twenty	years	have	been	serving	risotto	with	porcini	mushrooms
and	blueberries	tossed	in	at	the	last	second.

I	also	like	to	make	a	risotto	with	fresh	herbs	like	rosemary,	thyme,	or	oregano	—	and
then	at	the	end	I’ll	cover	it	with	an	extra-thin	slice	of	lard	[pork	jowl]	that	has	a	mild	flavor.	It
just	melts	into	the	risotto	and	is	out	of	this	world.
Each	ingredient	you	add	to	your	risotto	will	dictate	when	it	should	be	added.	If	it	is
something	delicate	like	a	berry,	it	gets	added	very	late	so	it	will	not	break	up.	If	you	are
making	a	seafood	risotto	—	say,	with	octopus	—	it	should	be	added	early	so	it	has	time	to
cook	all	the	way	through.

—	Brad	Farmerie,	Public	(New	York	City)

Floral	flavors,	when	done	well,	can	be	really	amazing.	This	is	also	special	because	it	is	something	that	I
never	grew	up	with.	Someone	from	India	may	not	find	it	a	big	deal.

I	tend	to	think	in	threes.	I’ll	pair	two	classic	ingredients,	and	add	a	third	to	elevate	the	combination.	I
make	my	own	rose-flavored	dessert	that	was	inspired	by	[French	pastry	chef]	Pierre	Hermé	and	his	rose
macaroon	with	raspberry	and	lychee,	which	is	one	of	the	greatest	things	I	have	tasted	in	my	life.	I	coat	a
standard	tart	shell	with	a	layer	of	liquid	raspberry;	on	top	of	that	I	place	a	rose	parfait,	which	I	pair	with
lemon	and	pistachio.	To	make	the	rose	flavor	not	so	overbearing,	I	use	it	in	three	different	forms.	I	infuse
rosebuds	[used	to	make	rosewater]	in	the	milk	for	the	parfait,	and	I	also	use	rose	syrup,	which	adds	color
and	sweetness,	and	finally	rosewater	as	well.	You	have	to	be	careful	with	rose	because	it	can	be	like
eating	perfume.	That	is	why	I	take	a	lot	of	care	using	three	layers	to	make	it	one	flavor.

Rosemary	has	a	strong	flavor,	so	it’s	always	going	to	be	the	star.	It	works	with	strong,	assertive	fish	like
swordfish	or	tuna	—	and,	of	course,	it	is	a	classic	with	lamb.
—	DAVID	WALTUCK,	CHANTERELLE	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Rosemary	works	with	apples	or	pears.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

When	I	think	of	rosemary,	I	think	of	octopus.	It	works	so	well	in	a	ceviche	with	octopus,	black	olives,
and	potato.
—	KATSUYA	FUKUSHIMA,	MINIBAR	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

Rosemary	can	be	strong	with	seafood	unless	it	is	a	full-flavored	seafood.	We	will	skewer	mussels	with
rosemary	and	panfry	them	because	they	work	with	the	piney	flavor	of	the	mussels.
—	JERRY	TRAUNFELD,	THE	HERBFARM	(WOODINVILLE,	WASHINGTON)

Rosemary	works	well	with	citrus	and	honey.

The	Martinique	rums	tend	to	be	drier,	while	Haitian	rums	tend	to	be	spicier.	I	use	more	spices	with	rum
in	general,	and	herbs	with	spirits	such	as	gin.
—	JERRI	BANKS,	COCKTAIL	CONSULTANT	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

I	love	the	combination	of	rum	with	carrots.	Carrot	juice	provides	a	bright	color	that	sends	a	message,
especially	to	women.	It	has	its	own	natural	sweetness,	and	a	little	goes	a	long	way.	Carrots	go	beautifully
with	lemon	thyme	and	orange,	but	I	especially	love	the	combination	of	carrots	and	ginger.	In	the	autumn
months,	I’ll	combine	gold	rum	with	carrot	and	apple	juices	and	autumn	spices.	I’ll	infuse	allspice,
cinnamon,	and	nutmeg	into	a	tea	or	tisane,	and	add	that	to	the	cocktail.

Saffron	Panna	Cotta	with	“Agrumi	Misti”	and	Blood	Orange	Sorbetto
—	Gina	DePalma,	pastry	chef,	Babbo	(New	York	City)

I	would	definitely	have	saffron	on	hand	for	Spanish	cooking.	It	lends	itself	to	rice,	seafood,	meat,	and
poultry.	You	can	combine	saffron	and	salt	together	for	a	saffron	salt	that	is	incredibly	aromatic.	Saffron
also	works	very	well	on	a	salad.	People	forget	that	saffron	is	a	flower	and,	sprinkled	on	a	salad,	it
aromatizes	the	greens.
—	JOSÉ	ANDRÉS,	CAFÉ	ATLÁNTICO	(WASHINGTON,	DC)


Saffron	has	a	sweet	power.	It	is	a	classic	flavor	to	add	to	shellfish,	but	the	minute	you	taste	the	saffron	in
a	dish,	there	is	too	much.
—	MICHEL	RICHARD,	CITRONELLE	(WASHINGTON,	DC)

I	wanted	to	come	up	with	a	panna	cotta	that	was	unlike	anyone	else’s.	I	was	walking	down	the	street
thinking	of	Italian	dishes	and	risotto	Milanese	[which	is	made	with	saffron]	came	to	mind.	This	led	me	to
think	about	saffron,	and	the	idea	of	adding	saffron	to	my	panna	cotta.	After	Ruth	Reichl	mentioned	it	in
the	New	York	Times	review	of	Babbo,	Mario	[Batali]	told	me	I	could	never	take	it	off	the	menu!

Saffron	has	a	bright	metallic	flavor,	and	with	quince	—	which	is	floral,	delicate,	and	perfumed	—	it	is
wonderful.	Over	the	years,	I	have	found	that	saffron	unexpectedly	changes	its	flavor	depending	on	what
fruit	is	paired	with	it.	Each	fruit	I	work	with	either	turns	up	its	floral	component	or	its	metallic	flavor.
Saffron	is	great	with	stone	fruits	like	apples,	peaches,	pears,	plums,	and	figs.	It	also	works	with	citrus
like	blood	oranges,	kumquats,	and	grapefruit.	On	the	other	hand,	it	doesn’t	work	with	many	berries.	It
makes	strawberries	a	little	flat,	and	is	downright	awful	with	cranberries.

Every	salad	should	have	elements	of	bitter,	salt,	heat,	and	texture.	For	us,	the	bitter	component	is	often	the
greens.	We	use	a	lot	of	frisée,	radicchio,	and	endive.	But	there	always	needs	to	be	some	crunch	in	a	salad.
Even	if	it	is	a	delicate	salad,	you	need	to	find	a	way	to	get	a	crunch	in	there.	For	a	delicate	salad,	you	can
get	crunch	using	fried	shallot	rings	or	crispy	sage	leaves.	We	often	use	nuts	for	crunch.	Our	leaf	salad	has
a	cashew	brittle,	which	is	made	by	caramelizing	sugar	then	seasoning	it	with	salt,	black	pepper,	a	hint	of
madras	curry,	a	pinch	of	our	Moroccan	spice	blend	(eighteen	ingredients),	and	a	pinch	of	pepper	mix
(four	ingredients)	before	tossing	the	nuts	in.	The	other	components	of	the	salad	are	pomegranate	seeds,
bacon,	and	a	South	American	blue	cheese.
—	SHARON	HAGE,	YORK	STREET	(DALLAS)

When	you	are	eating	a	salad,	the	greens	are	the	main	ingredient,	so	whatever	you	add	has	to	elevate	them.
Lettuce	is	boring	by	itself,	so	you	elevate	it	with	the	vinaigrette.	We	will	use	herbs	in	our	salads,	but	they
must	not	overpower	the	greens;	they	have	to	be	very	subtle	and	used	in	small	amounts.	We	will	use	chives
or	fresh	parsley	leaves	or	a	combination	of	the	two.	We	may	also	add	some	mint	to	the	mix	because	it


pushes	the	flavors	of	the	greens.

The	Modern

The	salmon	is	roasted,	and	served	with	warm,	slightly	charred	cucumbers,	which	I	like
because	they	are	rarely	used	cooked.	We	use	market	vegetables	that	right	now	are	bok
choy	and	peas.	I	have	added	some	trout	caviar	for	a	briny	flavor	because	salmon	is	on	the
sweet	side.	The	dish	is	then	finished	with	a	hickory	broth.

For	the	hickory	broth,	we	smoke	some	hickory	chips,	wrap	them	in	cheesecloth	with
juniper	berries	and	peppercorns,	and	then	submerge	them	in	water	to	make	a	broth.	This
creates	a	smoked	sauce	that	is	light	and	tasty.	What	we	have	here	is	a	“wood	stock”	that
makes	perfect	sense	with	the	salmon	because	so	often	salmon	is	smoked.	After	the	wood


comes	out,	you	taste	the	broth	to	adjust	it.	It	may	need	some	more	water	to	cut	the	wood
and	smoke	flavor,	or	it	might	need	to	be	reduced	to	intensify	it.	We	finish	the	sauce	with	a
little	half-and-half,	and	foam	it	with	a	handheld	mixer.

Vitaly	Paley	of	Portland’s	Paley’s	Place	on	Cooking	Salmon
on	a	Plank

Salmon	is	a	big	part	of	cooking	in	the	Northwest.	We	get	ours	anywhere	from	Oregon	up	to
Alaska.

The	first	cooking	process	that	comes	to	mind	in	this	part	of	the	country	is	called	cedar

planking,	which	is	a	Native	American	technique.	You	see	planking	in	all	the	best	cooking
catalogs,	but	the	problem	is	that	you	cook	the	fish,	throw	it	out,	and	keep	the	plank
because	the	plank	is	inevitably	more	expensive	than	the	fish!	So	here	is	one	tip:	Instead,	do
what	we	do	and	go	to	a	lumber	yard	and	pick	up	untreated	cedar	shingles.	They	come	in	a
huge	bundle	for	$16.

To	get	the	most	out	of	plank	cooking,	the	salmon	needs	to	be	brined	or	marinated.	I
have	two	favorite	marinades	—	one	that	is	wet,	and	one	that	is	dry.	The	wet	marinade	is	a
60/40	mixture	of	soy	sauce	and	cream	sherry,	lots	of	sliced	ginger,	heads	of	garlic	cut	in
half,	and	chopped	scallions.	The	sherry	adds	just	a	touch	of	sweetness	to	the	fish,	which	I
like.	Let	the	fish	sit	in	that	marinade	for	a	couple	of	hours	and	then	it	is	ready	to	take	on	the
smoke.

The	dry	marinade	is	a	more	traditional	marinade	of	a	60/40	ratio	of	brown	sugar	and

salt	with	orange	zest	[grated]	on	a	microplane	[fine	grater].	I	mix	this	all	together	and
lavishly	rub	it	over	a	salmon	with	the	skin	on,	which	protects	it	from	getting	too	salty	or
sweet.	The	sugar	in	this	rub	balances	out	the	salt	and	adds	another	dimension	to	the	fish
with	caramelization	happening	a	lot	quicker.	The	sweetness	is	almost	hidden;	it	is	that
“What’s-that-flavor?”	aspect	to	the	fish.	Marinate	for	a	couple	of	hours,	then	wipe	off	the
rub	slightly,	and	it	is	ready	to	go.	The	60/40	ratio	of	sugar	to	salt	is	good	because	it	is
pretty	forgiving	if	you	leave	the	fish	in	the	marinade	a	half	hour	too	long.

I	recommend	brushing	the	plank	lightly	with	some	olive	oil,	throwing	it	on	a	hot	grill,
putting	the	fish	on,	and	letting	it	catch	on	fire,	because	when	the	plank	is	on	fire,	that	is	the
flavor	you	are	looking	for.	When	the	burning	plank	gets	close	to	the	fish,	cover	the	grill	to
smother	the	fire	and	let	the	smoke	do	the	rest	of	the	work.

Salmon	has	been	my	favorite	fish	since	I	learned	to	cook	it	correctly.	It	is	so	versatile:	you	can	smoke	it,
marinate	it,	or	even	serve	it	raw.	Because	it	is	rich	and	fatty,	it	pairs	well	with	everything	from	a	red	wine
sauce	to	a	simple	vinaigrette.

Tomato	and	pineapple	with	salmon:	This	dish	goes	back	to	1975	when	someone	gave	me	a	salad	of
tomato	and	pineapple.	I	didn’t	know	what	to	do	with	it,	so	I	stored	the	idea	away.	Today,	I	will	cook	the
tomato,	pineapple,	a	dash	of	white	wine	for	acid,	miso,	and	the	salmon	head,	which	bridges	and	brings	the


flavors	together.	Tomato	gets	fruitier	when	cooked	with	pineapple.	The	end	result	doesn’t	taste	like	either
tomato	or	pineapple;	it	is	a	new	flavor.	This	sauce	is	perfect	with	salmon.

I	love	combining	fruit	and	proteins.	I	am	one-half	Hawaiian,	and	in	Hawaiian	cooking	a	classic	dish	is
Spam	cooked	with	fresh	pineapple.	I	grew	up	with	my	father	making	it	for	us,	and	it	is	delicious.	You’ll
also	see	a	lot	of	sushi	chefs	combine	kiwi	and	scallops,	as	fruit	adds	a	nice	cleansing	note	to	the	protein
you	are	working	with.	Our	take	on	this	combination	is	pineapple	salmon	with	avocado	and	quinoa.	We	cut
pineapple	very	thin,	then	wrap	it	around	salmon	belly,	which	is	very	rich.	When	we	cook	it,	the	pineapple
gets	caramelized	and	helps	cut	the	fat	of	the	salmon.	On	the	dish	is	a	sweet-hot	sauce	of	avocado,	honey,
scallions,	and	serrano	chiles.	To	garnish	the	dish	and	add	some	crunch	we	add	quinoa	that	is	cooked	then
dried	for	three	days	before	cooking	it	in	olive	oil,	which	makes	it	puff	like	Rice	Krispies.

If	you	have	a	piece	of	Ibérico	or	Serrano	ham	in	your	refrigerator,	you’ll	eventually	end	up	with	this	little
end	of	dried-out	salt-cured	meat.	While	some	might	just	throw	it	away,	we	know	there’s	a	lot	of	flavor	left
—	so	we	grind	it	up	in	a	coffee	grinder	and	use	it	as	meat-flavored	salt.	We	call	this	“ham	salt,”	and	will
use	this	on	a	salad	to	emphasize	the	aroma	and	flavor	of	pork.	.	.	.	In	Spain	we	have	mojama,	which	is
tuna	loin	cured	like	ham.	We’ll	grind	it	up	in	a	coffee	grinder	and	it	becomes	tuna	salt.	When	I	sear	tuna,	I
will	sprinkle	this	on	and	emphasize	the	tuna	with	its	own	tuna	flavor.	It	is	simple	and	dramatic.	I	even
showed	this	technique	to	the	owner	of	the	best	tuna	restaurant	in	the	world	—	called	El	Campero	in

Kosher	salt	has	larger,	harder	crystals	and	won’t	break	down	too	fast.	I	use	this	for	pasta
water,	brining,	curing	meat,	and	charcuterie.	I	use	French	sea	salt	(esp.	Baleine)	for
general	seasoning.	I	like	Maldon	salt	a	lot.	This	is	what	I	use	for	finishing	dishes.	It	has	a
really	fine	crystal	and	the	flavor	is	great.	It	even	gives	some	crunch	and	melts	like
snowflakes.	It	is	great	sprinkled	on	raw	fish.

Salt	is	now	used	very	often	in	desserts	and	unfortunately	it	doesn’t	always	make	sense.	I
was	served	a	green	apple	sorbet	with	salt	and	it	didn’t	work.	Salt	does	work	on	sweet
oranges,	though.	If	you	cut	a	Cara	Cara	orange	into	wedges	and	sprinkle	sea	salt	on
them,	they	are	delicious.	Salt	also	makes	sense	with	caramel	and	butterscotch.	The	salt	is
a	contrast	to	the	super	sweet,	which	is	why	we	like	PayDay	candy	bars.

I	use	Maldon	salt	flakes	as	a	salt	for	finishing	dishes,	and	kosher	salt	for	blanching	water
or	when	I	roast	on	salt.	I’ll	sometimes	use	smoked	salt	with	raw	fish	or	in	a	brine	for	pork,
but	it’s	really	strong	so	you	have	to	be	careful	with	it.

There	is	salt	in	almost	all	of	my	desserts.	However,	you	would	not	know	it	was	there	until	I
took	it	out	—	which	is	how	it	should	be.	You	don’t	need	to	taste	the	salt,	but	it	helps	open
the	palate	and	stimulates	your	taste	buds.	With	something	fatty	like	chocolate,	you	need
some	salt	to	brighten	it	up.	I	use	all	sorts	of	salts	with	my	desserts.	We	are	making	a
peanut	butter	and	jelly	bonbon	that	I	pair	with	smoked	Brittany	sea	salt.	Maldon	salt	is
shaved	and	more	about	texture,	because	it	is	not	as	strong;	I	would	use	it	on	a	pancake	or
something	creamy.	Fleur	de	sel	is	a	salt	with	texture	and	ocean	floral	notes,	and	would	go
well	on	our	panini	which	have	cheese,	arugula,	and	vinaigrette.
—	JOHNNY	IUZZINI,	JEAN	GEORGES	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

Salt	goes	into	almost	every	dough	we	make	and	is	something	that	makes	flavors	pop.
Some	chefs	can	go	a	little	overboard,	but	desserts	should	still	be	sweet.	Salt	works	well
with	caramel	and	chocolate,	obviously.	I	also	use	a	vanilla	salt	with	a	classic	sweet
potato	tart	that	is	cut	into	four	slices	with	a	few	grains	on	each	slice.	The	salt	reinforces
the	savoriness	of	the	sweet	potato	and	plays	off	the	brightness	of	the	preserved	lemon	on
the	plate.
—	MICHAEL	LAISKONIS,	LE	BERNARDIN	(NEW	YORK	CITY)

To	counteract	oversalting	a	dish,	you	need	to	increase	the	volume	of	whatever	you	are
making.	That	can	be	tricky,	because	you	don’t	want	to	end	up	with	something	too	watery.
Whenever	there	is	a	puree	involved,	whether	it	is	mashed	potatoes	or	butternut	squash
soup,	I	encourage	my	cooks	to	make	it	thick.	You	can	always	add,	but	not	take	away.

SOUS-VIDE	COOKING

What	sous-vide	[“under	vacuum”]	cooking	does	is	give	you	a	long,	very	controlled	cooking	time.	I	like	to
use	it	on	vegetables	because	no	air	hits	the	vegetable.	All	the	white	vegetables	come	out	really	white.	It
also	keeps	the	whiteness	in	fruits	like	apples	and	pears.

VINEGAR	—	IN	GENERAL

I	use	a	variety	of	vinegars	and	right	now	I	am	using	cider	vinegar,	balsamic,	and	white	balsamic.	What
vinegar	you	grab	really	depends	on	how	far	you	can	push	the	product.	When	we	make	a	walnut	sauce,	it
can	handle	a	good-sized	dash	of	cider	vinegar.	In	a	fluke	tartare,	we’ll	only	use	a	drop	of	vinegar.
